In OVMF, the handler of "event X" is in the IOMMU driver itself, so it's
the IOMMU driver that takes care of blacklisting everything *after*
other drivers had a chance to clean up.

But in this case, we'd have to insert the PPB clearing *before* the
(platform's) IOMMU driver's EBS handler (because the latter is going to
deny, not permit, everything); and we can't modify the IOMMU driver.

I guess we could install an EBS handler with TPL_NOTIFY (PciIo usage
appears permitted at TPL_NOTIFY, from "Table 27. TPL Restrictions"). But:
- if the IOMMU driver's EBS handler is also to be enqueued at
TPL_NOTIFY, then the order will be unspecified
- if a PCI driver sets up an EBS handler at TPL_CALLBACK, then in our
handler we could shut down a PPB in front of a device bound by that
driver too early.

Handling dependencies between event notification functions is a
never-ending struggle in UEFI, AFAICT.
