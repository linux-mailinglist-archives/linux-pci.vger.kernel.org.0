Yes, this makes slot reset "safe". But bus reset is "unsafe".

That should work when slot reset is available.

Other option is that mentioned remove-reset-rescan procedure.

But quick search in drivers/pci/hotplug/ results that not all hotplug
drivers implement reset_slot method.

So there is a possible issue with hotplug driver which may eject device
during bus reset (because e.g. slot reset is not implemented)?
