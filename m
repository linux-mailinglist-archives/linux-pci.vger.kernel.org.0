I still think it would be ideal if we could expose both values to userspace
rather than combine them somehow. Hmm. Anyway...

I struggled to figure out exactly what's being counted from the
documentation patch (please update that). Please can you explain exactly
what appears in the HISI_PCIE_CNT and HISI_PCIE_EXT_CNT registers for the
different modes of operation? Without that, the ratios you've chosen to
report seem rather arbitrary.

I also couldn't figure out how the latency event works. For example, I was
assuming it would be a filter (a bit like the length), so you could say
things like "I'm only interested in packets with a latency higher than x"
but it doesn't look like it works that way.

Thanks,

Will
