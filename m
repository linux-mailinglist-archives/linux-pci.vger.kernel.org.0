Wait, what?  How can we get to a number that large for the virtual
function ID?  devfn is 8 bits, bus is a further 8 bits.  Sure, domain
is an extra 16 bits on top of that but I'm pretty sure that virtual
functions can't span multiple domains.  Unless that's changed recently?

Even if they can, we'd need to span 2^14 domains to get up to a billion
IDs.  That's a hell of a system and I think overflowing here is the
least of our problems.

So while this is typed as u32, I don't think it can get anywhere close.
