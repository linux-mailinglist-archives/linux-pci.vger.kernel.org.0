Great, so you have a real platform device down there at the "root" of
all of this, that is doleing out resources to other "child" drivers.

Great, so it's a real firmware device, use that as a platform device and
use the resources available there.

If this really is a firmware thing, and you have a firmware device, then
I am confused why this was even brought up at all?  Use a real platform
device, with the resources that are needed to talk to this platform
device and you should be fine.

BUT, if you are making child devices that are NOT actually talking to
the firmware, then make it a faux device and deal with the fact that you
can't load modules because it's a fake device that no hardware
definition is there for :)

Does that make sense?
