"System Error" is probably incorrect. You've already stated, that
these error bits are generally disabled in the PCI_EXP_RTCTL reg in
aer_enable_rootport():

	/* Disable system error generation in response to error messages */
	pcie_capability_clear_word(pdev, PCI_EXP_RTCTL,
				   SYSTEM_ERROR_INTR_ON_MESG_MASK);

This leaves "Error Interrupt", but I might be wrong here.

Here the value of the PCI_EXP_RTCTL register at runtime:
# setpci -v -s 00:00.0 CAP_EXP+0x1c.w
0000:00:00.0 (cap 10 @60) @7c = 0010

So all "System Error" enable bits are disabled.

Please let me know if I should make some other "setpci" tests.

AFAICT this is the case here.

Agreed. So how to process with this patchset? Should I reword the
patch subject line (and the commit text and comments) to something like:

Add option to setup IRQs for platform-specific Error Interrupt ?

Thanks,
Stefan
