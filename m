Okay that now looks like what is expected. The firmware re-connects the
tunnels and the resume can continue.

I actually don't know what that option does either but I would expect
that it leaves the PME and small power enabled for the port so that
probably allows the firmware to do this even in "secure" mode or so.

If you apply the patch from here:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pci/pci.git/commit/?h=pm&id=6786c2941fe1788035f99c98c932672138b3fbc5

Does the problem go away with the disconnect case too (and so that you
have "secure" enabled)?
