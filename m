I guess that this is the main issue as all other fixes and improvements
are stalled. Just to remind that we have there shared interrupt source
(which can be requested by more HW drivers) and consumer is PCIe INTX
which is de-facto chained handler. And I have not seen anything for
shared interrupt source except request_irq(IRQF_SHARED) which you do not
want to use for shared interrupts anymore. Also setting of PCIe INTX
affinity is broken which worked fine with the previous kernel versions.
And you also rejected fixes for this regression.
