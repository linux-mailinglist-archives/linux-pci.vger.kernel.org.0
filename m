Kernel AER driver is not available when MSI is not supported:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/pcie/aer.c?h=v5.15#n112
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/pcie/portdrv_core.c?h=v5.15#n224
Originally this was my primary indication that AER is MSI(X)-only.

And my understanding is that AER Root Error Status Register (7.8.4.10)
specifies Advanced Error Interrupt Message Number which indicates which
MSI(X) interrupt is used. And there is no information about INTx if you
enable particular reporting category via AER Root Error Command Register.
That is why I was in impression that AER interrupts are MSI-only.

But now I'm looking at 6.2.4.1.2 section and seems that AER can really
use INTx. So I was wrong here.

But why then kernel AER driver has check that AER is available only when
MSI is enabled? And not available when MSI is disabled?

So, seems that this is anther PCIe controller which does not report AER
interrupt via standard MSI interrupts but via some vendor-specific way.
