I misunderstood the usage of pcim_iomap_table() -- it looks like one
must call pcim_iomap_regions() *first*, and test its result, and
*that* is where we should catch any pcim_iomap_table() failures, e.g.,

  rc = pcim_iomap_regions()   # or pcim_iomap_regions_request_all()
  if (rc)
    return rc;                # pcim_iomap_table() or other failure

  vaddr = pcim_iomap_table()[BAR];
  if (!vaddr)
    return -ENOMEM;           # BAR doesn't exist

You *do* correctly call pcim_iomap_regions() first, which calls
pcim_imap_table() internally, so if pcim_iomap_table() were to return
NULL, you should catch it there.

Then we assume that the subsequent "pcim_iomap_table()[BAR]" call will
succeed and NOT return NULL, so it should be safe to index into the
table.  And if the table[BAR] entry is NULL, it means the BAR doesn't
exist or isn't mapped.

That sort of makes sense, but the API design doesn't quite seem
obviously correct to me.  The table was created by
pcim_iomap_regions(), and pcim_iomap_table() is basically retrieving
that artifact.

I wonder if it could be improved by making pcim_iomap_table() strictly
internal to devres.c and having the pcim_iomap functions return the
table directly.  Then the code would look something like this:

  table = pcim_iomap_regions();
  if (IS_ERR(table))
    return PTR_ERR(table);    # pcim_iomap_table() or other failure

  vaddr = table[BAR];         # "table" is guaranteed to be non-NULL
  if (!vaddr)
    return -ENOMEM;

Obviously this is not something you should do for *this* series.
I think you should follow the example of other drivers, which means
keeping your patch exactly as you posted it.  I'm just interested in
opinions on this as a possible future API improvement.

Bjorn
