We added a description of this problem to the document on the Huawei 
support website:
https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1100063073/87950645/vm-oss-occasionally-fail-to-load-the-in200-driver-when-the-vf-performs-flr

Yes, any process that can trigger multiple VF parallel FLRs has this 
problem.

The FLR processing of Huawei NIC is completed by the cooperation of 
hardware and firmware. The hardware can be executed in parallel and 
ensured within 100ms, but the firmware processing can only be executed 
serially; bus/device clearing and capturing are all completed by 
hardware, so it can be directly complete the config write operation here.

Waiting for FLR timeout here means that the firmware has not executed 
FLR for a period of time, but eventually FLR will be executed. We expect 
PCIE to be initialized after the timeout to ensure that PCIE is normal; 
even if VF initialization fails at the beginning, we do not restart the 
virtual machine, But after the remove/insmod driver, it can still be 
used normally.
