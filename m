This patch adds support for OPP to vote for the performance state of RPMH
power domain based upon PCIe speed it got enumerated.

QCOM Resource Power Manager-hardened (RPMh) is a hardware block which
maintains hardware state of a regulator by performing max aggregation of
the requests made by all of the processors.

PCIe controller can operate on different RPMh performance state of power
domain based up on the speed of the link. And this performance state varies
from target to target.

It is manadate to scale the performance state based up on the PCIe speed
link operates so that SoC can run under optimum power conditions.

Add Operating Performance Points(OPP) support to vote for RPMh state based
upon GEN speed link is operating.

Before link up PCIe driver will vote for the maximum performance state.

As now we are adding ICC BW vote in OPP, the ICC BW voting depends both
GEN speed and link width using opp-level to indicate the opp entry table
will be difficult.

In PCIe certain gen speeds like 2.5GT/s x2 & 5.0 GT/s X1 or 8.0 GT/s x2 &
16GT/s x1 use same ICC bw if we use freq in the OPP table to represent the
PCIe speed number of PCIe entries can reduced.

So going back to use freq in the OPP table instead of level.

To access PCIe registers of the host controller and endpoint PCIe
BAR space, config space the CPU-PCIe ICC (interconnect) path should
be voted otherwise it may lead to NoC (Network on chip) timeout.
We are surviving because of other driver voting for this path.

As there is less access on this path compared to PCIe to mem path
add minimum vote i.e 1KBps bandwidth always which is sufficient enough
to keep the path active and is recommended by HW team.

In suspend to ram case there can be some DBI access. Except in suspend
to ram case disable CPU-PCIe ICC path after register space access
is done.

	- As we added the icc bw voting in opp table I am not including reviewed
	- by tags given in previous patch.
	- Use opp freq to find opp entries as now we need to include pcie link
	- also in to considerations.
	- Add CPU-PCIe BW voting which is not present till now.
	- Drop  PCI: qcom: Return error from 'qcom_pcie_icc_update' as either opp or icc bw
	- only one executes and there is no need to fail if opp or icc update fails.

changes from v3:
	- Removing the opp vote on suspend when the link is not up and link is not
	  up and add debug prints as suggested by pavan.
	- Added dev_pm_opp_find_level_floor API to find the highest opp to vote.
