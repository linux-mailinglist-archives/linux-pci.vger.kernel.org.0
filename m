Yes, this is exactly the issue. The PCIe tunnel is not up and that makes
the OS to remove the devices during resume. The delay just makes it more
"visible".

OK, this is "Alpine Ridge Low Power" and for that the firmware seems to
be quite recent.

[You could do that in Linux too but Lenovo does not seem to ship the
firmware through LVFS.]

OK. Did you change any BIOS settings from the defaults that might have
affect on this? Sometimes these are exposed to through the BIOS menu and
the user can change those (Lenovo typically does not, expose them
though).

Can you also attach output of acpidump to and dmesg with
"thunderbolt.dyndbg=+p" in the command line?
