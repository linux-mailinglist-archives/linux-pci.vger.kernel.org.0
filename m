Hi Christoph,

Thanks for your comments. I'm also replying here to your comments on the 
previous series.

Some machines don't expose the video BIOS in the PCI BAR and instead only make 
it available via EFI boot services calls. So drivers need to be able to use 
the ROM provided by EFI calls, but only if they can't find a valid one anywhere 
else.

At one point, the EFI provided ROM in pdev->rom *was* exposed via 
pci_map_rom(). However it had to be split out into a separate function so that 
drivers could have more control over which sources were preferred.

Addressed in v2

I think the direct access to pdev->rom you suggest makes sense, especially 
because users of the pci_platform_rom() are exposed to the fact that it just 
calls ioremap().

I decided against wrapping the iounmap() with a pci_unmap_platform_rom(), but 
I didn't apply the same consideration to the existing function.

How about something like this (with pci_platform_rom() removed)?

static bool radeon_read_platform_bios(struct radeon_device *rdev)
{
	phys_addr_t rom = rdev->pdev->rom;
	size_t romlen = rdev->pdev->romlen;
	void __iomem *bios;

	rdev->bios = NULL;

	if (!rom || romlen == 0)
		return false;

	rdev->bios = kzalloc(romlen, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!rdev->bios)
		return false;

	bios = ioremap(rom, romlen);
	if (!bios)
		goto free_bios;

	memcpy_fromio(rdev->bios, bios, romlen);
	iounmap(bios);

	if (rdev->bios[0] != 0x55 || rdev->bios[1] != 0xaa)
		goto free_bios;

	return true;
free_bios:
	kfree(rdev->bios);
	return false;
}

If this is preferred, I'll send an updated series. I'm assuming that the 
removal of pci_platform_rom() and updating of all the callers should be 
combined into this patch.

Thanks,
Mikel
