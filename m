I definitely want to pursue this in some form.  My first thought is to
just leave L1.2 config untouched because despite my hand-waving in
80d7d7a904fa ("PCI/ASPM: Calculate LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD from device
characteristics"), I'm unconvinced that Linux has enough information
to configure L1.2 correctly.

I raised this in the PCI-SIG firmware working group yesterday and
there was some feeling that we actually *do* know enough (with the
help of an LTR _DSM), so maybe it's just that I don't understand it
well enough.

Alex recently reported an ASPM issue, and I point him at the debug
patch but haven't had a chance to look at his results yet:
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250705134201.GA2004436@bhelgaas
Possibly completely unrelated.
