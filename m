If you're reasonably confident that nobody will notice the removal of
support for Rev1, we can include that in the commit log and just
remove it.

The original commit log basically said "we don't want to support Rev1"
without any indication of where those parts went or whether anybody
might care about them.  But if Rev1 only went to partners for
evaluation and we don't expect end users to have them, I think it's
reasonable to say that and remove the code.
