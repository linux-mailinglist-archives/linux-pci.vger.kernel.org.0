Subject: [PATCH 4/6] PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Fix definitions of reserved bits

Some bits in PCI_EXP registers are reserved for non-root ports. Driver
pci-bridge-emul.c implements PCIe Root Port device therefore it should not
allow setting reserved bits of registers.

Properly define non-reserved bits for all PCI_EXP registers.
