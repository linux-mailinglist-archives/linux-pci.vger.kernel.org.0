No, this is final. Show anything in /proc/*, maintain it forever. We
already went there with the bogomips crap showing up in
/proc/cpuinfo. There is no way you can know what userspace does, and
the best course of action is not to change things for some dubious
value of "nicer" or "less confusing".

No, you would have to keep the *exact same output*. Userspace doesn't
know about drivers, and expect things in /proc to be stable.

Frankly, there are more important things to do than to worry about the
shape of /proc/interrupts. And if we could change it, I'd simply get
rid of it (you really should look at it on a system that has ~200
CPUs...).

Thanks,
