Maybe it is not concern at all, but this approach will make
forward/backward compatibility without kernel upgrade impossible.

Once QEMU (example) will have needed support, someone will need to remove
the QEMU from this array, rewrite on_bare_metal() because it is not bare
vs. virtual anymore and require kernel upgrade/downgrade every time QEMU
version is switched.

Plus need to update stable@ and distros.

I'm already feeling pain from the fields while they debug such code.

Am I missing it completely?

Thanks
