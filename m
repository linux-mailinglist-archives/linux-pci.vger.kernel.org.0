Do you have a reference for this?  I don't see anything in the PCIe
spec that suggests platforms must limit MRRS, and it seems that only
these ARM-related controllers have this issue.  If there *is* a
platform connection here, we'll need some way to discover it, e.g.,
an ACPI _DSM method or similar.

The only guidance in the spec about setting MRRS is that:

  - Software must set Max_Read_Request_Size of an
    isochronous-configured device with a value that does not exceed
    the Max_Payload_Size set for the device (PCIe r5.0, sec 6.3.4.1)

  - The Max_Read_Request_Size mechanism allows improved control of
    bandwidth allocation in systems where Quality of Service (QoS) is
    important for the target applications. For example, an arbitration
    scheme based on counting Requests (and not the sizes of those
    Requests) provides imprecise bandwidth allocation when some
    Requesters use much larger sizes than others. The
    Max_Read_Request_Size mechanism can be used to force more uniform
    allocation of bandwidth, by restricting the upper size of Read
    Requests (sec 7.5.3.4 implementation note)
