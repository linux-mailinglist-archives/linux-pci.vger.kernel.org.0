I guess I wasn't clear enough above. Let me rephrase this:

My patch was only dealing with the kernel side of things, not the
userspace ABI. That ABI should be carried on unchanged, which requires
additional changes in the sysfs code.

Given that we can't prove that it is actually the case, I believe this
is the only option.
