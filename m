That matches my understanding.

I don't disagree. Again, this one is on Greg to comment on. Personally, I'm
fine with both.

Agreed.

We'd need to split them, because they potentially would return different types.
(Again, I don't think that's necessary though.)

For C it's just a void pointer, so we don't bother there, but in Rust we'd want
it type safe.

Sure, I already got this on my list of changes for the next version.
