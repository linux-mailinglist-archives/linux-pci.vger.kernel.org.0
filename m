I'm not sure "register separate IRQ domain for Root Port Bridge".
Do you mean that your suggestion is to create new IRQ domain, and add this domain to root port?
Or could you show me something example?

The re-trigger part is the same method as v5 patch I wrote.

I see.
GIC interrupt for MSI is handled by the MSI domain by pcie-designware-host.c.
My concern is how to trigger PME/AER event with another IRQ domain.

Thank you,
