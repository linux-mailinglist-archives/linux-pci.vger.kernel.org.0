I think this is not ASPM related as card simply disappear just after
flipping PCI_EXP_LNKCTL_RL bit second time without changing ASPM bits.

It is possible that this is aardvark issue. As I said I really do not
know.

In aardvark driver there is already merged workaround for this issue:
driver force gen1 aardvark mode for gen1 card.

Yes.

Yes, it is problematic. For example following commit broke those cards:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f4c7d053d7f77cd5c1a1ba7c7ce085ddba13d1d7

And this commit fixed it (just msleep was moved to different stage):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6964494582f56a3882c2c53b0edbfe99eb32b2e1

But we somehow need to deal with it until we find root cause.

Basically additional sleep in aardvark init phase can break WLE900VX
cards, but not WLE200VX.

And because WLE900VX works fine with pci-mvebu and WLE200VX works fine
with pci-aardvark we cannot deduce from it if problem for combination of
WLE900VX and aardvark is in WLE900VX or in aardvark.

There is absolutely nothing regarding to timings in documentation which
I saw. In documentation are just instructions/steps how to init PCI
subsystem and it is basically advk_pcie_setup_hw() function.

Hm... I cannot find right now pointer to bugzilla, but I have pointer to
ath9k-devel mailing list with that incorrect device id:

https://www.mail-archive.com/ath9k-devel@lists.ath9k.org/msg07529.html

> Is the incorrect device ID 0xffff?

No, incorrect device ID in that case is 0xabcd and vendor ID is correct
(Qualcomm).

It is strange and also reason why discussion on that list is long.

As I said, I'm not seeing that problem with wrong device ID.

But I know people who are observing same problem on different boards
(which do not use aardvark) as described in above mailing list thread
with Compex ath10k cards.

This is another/different problem and is already "documented" in kernel
bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84821#c52
