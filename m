Dear Ilpo,

Thanks your for reply. Only DWC and CDNS drivers are used here, what do 
you suggest should be done?

The original function is in the following file:
drivers/pci/controller/dwc/pcie-designware.c
u8 dw_pcie_find_capability(struct dw_pcie *pci, u8 cap)
u16 dw_pcie_find_ext_capability(struct dw_pcie *pci, u8 cap)

CDNS has the same need to find the offset of the capability.

We don't have pci_dev before calling pci_host_probe, but we want to get 
the offset of the capability and configure some registers to initialize 
the root port. Therefore, the __pci_find_next_cap_ttl function cannot be 
used. This is also the purpose of dw_pcie_find_*capability.


The CDNS driver does not have a cdns_pcie_find_*capability function. 
Therefore, separate the find capability, and then DWC and CDNS can be 
used at the same time to reduce duplicate code.

I agree, it would be really nice to share this code.

It looks a little messy to deal with passing around pointers to
controller read ops, and we'll still end up with a lot of duplicated
code between __pci_find_next_cap() and __cdns_pcie_find_next_cap(),
etc.

Maybe someday we'll make a generic way to access non-PCI "config"
space like this host controller space and PCIe RCRBs.

Or if you add interfaces that accept read/write ops, maybe the
existing pci_find_capability() etc could be refactored on top of them
by passing in pci_bus_read_config_word() as the accessor.
