To be honest, I am not sure this is suitable.
PCIe 5.0r1.0 spec section 9.3.3.2 SR-IOV Capabilities Register
VF 10-Bit Tag Requester Supported defined in BIT[2].

9.3.3.3 SR-IOV Control Register (Offset 08h)
VF 10-Bit Tag Requester Enable defined in BIT[5] and this is after the 
BIT[4] ARI Capable Hierarchy.

Howerver if we need to keep consistent with the "IOVCap". I can
move the "10BitTagReq" in the "IOVCtl" after the "Migration".

Good suggestion, will fix.
