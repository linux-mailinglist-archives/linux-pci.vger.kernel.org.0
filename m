Subject: [PATCH v2] PCI: hotplug: Fix kernel-doc formatting and add missing documentation
Date:   Fri,  2 Jul 2021 22:18:04 +0000
Message-Id: <20210702221804.1668189-1-kw@linux.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.32.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-pci.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-pci@vger.kernel.org

Fix kernel-doc formatting and add missing documentation for the
parameters "bus" of the get_slot_mapping() function, "t" of the
cpqhp_pushbutton_thread() function and "controller" of the
inband_presence_disabled() function.

Also remove surplus parameter "slot" from the description of the
function cpqhp_pushbutton_thread().

Thus, resolve build time warnings related to kernel-doc:

  drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:308: warning: Function parameter or member 'bus' not described in 'get_slot_mapping'
  drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:308: warning: Function parameter or member 'bus_num' not described in 'get_slot_mapping'
  drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:308: warning: Function parameter or member 'dev_num' not described in 'get_slot_mapping'
  drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_core.c:308: warning: Function parameter or member 'slot' not described in 'get_slot_mapping'

  drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_ctrl.c:1887: warning: Function parameter or member 't' not described in 'cpqhp_pushbutton_thread'
  drivers/pci/hotplug/cpqphp_ctrl.c:1887: warning: Excess function parameter 'slot' description in 'cpqhp_pushbutton_thread'

  drivers/pci/hotplug/pciehp.h:110: warning: Function parameter or member 'inband_presence_disabled' not described in 'controller'

No change to functionality intended.
