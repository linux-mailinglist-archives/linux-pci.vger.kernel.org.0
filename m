Background: I took over submitting this patchset from Bharat. Here his
last revision:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg2960164.html

Just to explain, that I didn't choose the naming.

To answer your question I personally think too, that "System Errors" is
more appropriate than "Service Errors". But still this patchset replaces
or better enhances the already present pcie_init_service_irqs() by a
platform-specific version. I can only suspect, that this is the
reasoning for this "Service" naming.

Interesting, thanks. Again, I didn't write the original commit text,
so my comments are a bit "limited" here. Perhaps Bharat might have
something add here?

Bharat?

Here the quote from Bharat's original cover letter:
"Some platforms have dedicated IRQ lines for PCIe services like AER/PME
etc. The root complex on these platform will use these seperate IRQ
lines to report AER/PME etc., interrupts and will not generate MSI/
MSI-X/INTx interrupts for these services.
These patches will add new method for these kind of platforms to
register the platform IRQ number with respective PCIe services."

To sum it up, on our Xilinx ZynqMP platform this patch series is needed
to deliver AER related interrupts. As this SoC needs this platform
specific IRQ line for signalling of these events.
