Ok, it is better describe the issue correctly.

I was expecting such answer. I think that we have been discussing this

I remember that I read this in Cortex-A53 documentation. Let me find it.

It is here:
ARM Cortex-A53 MPCore Processor Technical Reference Manual r0p3 - Support for v8 memory types:
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0500/e/level-1-memory-system/support-for-v8-memory-types

"nGnRnE - Treated the same as nGnRE inside a Cortex-A53 processor"

So really, disabling Early-acknowledge has no effect on A53.

Unless there is hidden/proprietary/undocumented bits for PCIe controller
to disable generating AXI errors, or ability to use only synchronous
access to affected memory from ARM core (e.g. by nE) there is really not
much what can be done here. I can just say that this is badly designed HW.

One more thing, if I remember correctly, ARMv8 specifies that Syndrome
register which delivers SError has some bits reserved for optional
feature - target AXI slave id which sent AXI Error. A53 does not
implement it and I highly doubt that other licensed ARM cores have them.
But maybe you could check A72. But even with that I'm really not sure if
it could be possible to catch SError, detect that it was sent by AXI
slave corresponding to PCIe controller and ignore it.
