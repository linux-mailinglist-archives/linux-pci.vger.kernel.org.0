Not necessary, a notifier is used to notice the device removal and avoid dereferencing the
NULL pointer. If you find another way like above to avoid the issue it will be ok. Since
your pmu is 1:1 related to the root port, add a devm action to unregister the PMU on root
port removal looks better.

Thanks.
