That's not my point.

My point was you said "between B (config request) and A (exit from
reset)".  "A" happens first, so it should be mentioned first.

Yes, please.  Handling them as a group is less overhead and helps
avoid merge issues (if they're all in a series there's no possibility
that the user gets merged before the macro itself).
