Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for taking a look.

I agree entirely, but not sure what to do about it whilst fitting in
the style that lscpi already has.

We could:
1. Wrap where possible, but leave the same deep indents.  That would get rid
   of some of the long lines but still leave an excessive seeming amount
   of indentation.
2. Reduce the indent, perhaps by not having the separate layer for
   which DVSEC it is.

	Capabilities: [600 v0] DVSEC: CCIX - Transport Layer

The second 600 is redundant anyway.

I'm not sure if that potentially overloads things too much as hard
to know what future DVSECs will be defined with really long names.

Gah. That's what I get for copy typing that stuff between two machines rather
than figuring out the games to get it from one to the other.
Sorry about that!

True enough. Note this stuff only applies if a section of the spec is
actually quoted.  As I understand it, things like field names etc
are covered by fair use.  Note that this whole series doesn't have
such a copyright notice, because I don't believe there are any
quotations from the specification in here.

The whole thing is a bit unfortunate, but the intent on the copyright stuff is
that any substantial quotes from any spec should have that anyway.  The
real aim is the trademark grant bit. I gather that's all about showing
you are actively maintaining your trademark (granting it's use with particular
scope counts).

As a non lawyer I'm certainly not a good source on this, but as I understand
it there is no problem in using it to describe a CCIX device etc, but that
it only gets dodgy if it becomes part of a 'product' name or similar.

It is also worth noting that anything using PCI-SIG terms is also under
a trademark policy...

That's probably not a can of worms to open though (it makes a scary
read)

I'll tidy them up for V2. Thanks!
