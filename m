Subject: [PATCH v5 0/6] Raspberry Pi 4 PCIe support

This series aims at providing support for Raspberry Pi 4's PCIe
controller, which is also shared with the Broadcom STB family of
devices.

There was a previous attempt to upstream this some years ago[1] but was
blocked as most STB PCIe integrations have a sparse DMA mapping[2] which
is something currently not supported by the kernel.  Luckily this is not
the case for the Raspberry Pi 4.

Note the series is based on top of linux next, as the DTS patch depends
on it.

Changes since v4:
  - Rebase DTS patch
  - Respin log2.h code into it's own series as it's still contentious
    yet mostly unrelated to the PCIe part

Changes since v3:
  - Moved all the log2.h related changes at the end of the series, as I
    presume they will be contentious and I don't want the PCIe patches
    to depend on them. Ultimately I think I'll respin them on their own
    series but wanted to keep them in for this submission just for the
    sake of continuity.
  - Addressed small nits here and there.

Changes since v2:
  - Redo register access in driver avoiding indirection while keeping
    the naming intact
  - Add patch editing ARM64's config
  - Last MSI cleanups, notably removing MSIX flag
  - Got rid of all _RB writes
  - Got rid of all of_data
  - Overall churn removal
  - Address the rest of Andrew's comments

Changes since v1:
  - add generic rounddown/roundup_pow_two64() patch
  - Add MAINTAINERS patch
  - Fix Kconfig
  - Cleanup probe, use up to date APIs, exit on MSI failure
  - Get rid of linux,pci-domain and other unused constructs
  - Use edge triggered setup for MSI
  - Cleanup MSI implementation
  - Fix multiple cosmetic issues
  - Remove supend/resume code
