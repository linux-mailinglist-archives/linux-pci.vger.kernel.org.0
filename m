Hi Jim & Bjorn,

7.7.3.4 Lane Equalization Control Register is for gen3 speed, for gen4
we had a new capability register 7.7.5.9 16.0 GT/s Lane Equalization 
Control Register for gen5 we have 7.7.6.9 32.0 GT/s Lane Equalization 
Control Register.

for gen3 we should not use uint8 as gen3 as transmitter preset and
receiver preset hint thus for each lane we need to have uint16 instead
of uint8 as we are defining per lane property in driver where we use
each uint16 value of array needs to be mapped correctly in the register.
If we have only support for single lane then last 16 bits becomes
invalid. so for 16 lanes we need to uint16 array each of uint16 instead
of uint8. ( I will modify it to uint16 instead of uint16)

for remaining gen speeds we don't have receiver preset hint, and it
requires only 8 bits to represent a lane only. so i will use only uint8
for remaining gen speeds.

Bjorn,

from PCIe spec 8.3.3.3 Tx Equalization Presets for 8.0, 16.0, 32.0, and
64.0 GT/ tells which preset value we neeed to use based upon different
parameters. Based upon the type of the board hardware one has to
calculate the preset value and provide them using these properties.
