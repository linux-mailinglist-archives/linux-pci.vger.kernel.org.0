I do not see any pci-bus.yaml file in linux kernel tree... It is missing
or it is external?

For, for cases with single root port on host bridge bus, it could be
possible to have these port/link properties directly in host bridge
node. As it is unambiguous what they describe and to which hw part they
belong.

Yes, some of them are doing it. And it would be a good if it is a
requirement for all new multi-port bindings and pcie controller drivers.

As it is a mess if every driver define these properties by its own.
Having one common / standard driver agnostic way for defining
complicated topology is really better.

Ok. I probably omitted more properties here. I just wanted to show
example how link speeds and PERST# pins are defined here.
