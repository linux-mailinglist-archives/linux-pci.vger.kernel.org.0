There isn't really much value add in the hmm_devmem_add wrapper.  Just
factor out a little helper to find the resource, and otherwise let the
driver implement the dev_pagemap_ops directly.

 unaware of the difference. We only need to make sure that no one ever tries to
 map those pages from the CPU side.
 
-HMM provides a set of helpers to register and hotplug device memory as a new
-region needing a struct page. This is offered through a very simple API::
-
- struct hmm_devmem *hmm_devmem_add(const struct hmm_devmem_ops *ops,
-                                   struct device *device,
-                                   unsigned long size);
- void hmm_devmem_remove(struct hmm_devmem *devmem);
-
-The hmm_devmem_ops is where most of the important things are::
-
- struct hmm_devmem_ops {
-     void (*free)(struct hmm_devmem *devmem, struct page *page);
-     vm_fault_t (*fault)(struct hmm_devmem *devmem,
-                  struct vm_area_struct *vma,
-                  unsigned long addr,
-                  struct page *page,
-                  unsigned flags,
-                  pmd_t *pmdp);
- };
-
-The first callback (free()) happens when the last reference on a device page is
-dropped. This means the device page is now free and no longer used by anyone.
-The second callback happens whenever the CPU tries to access a device page
-which it cannot do. This second callback must trigger a migration back to
-system memory.
