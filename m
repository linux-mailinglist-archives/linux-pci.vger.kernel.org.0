 Correct.

 Correct.

 Agreed.

 Your recollection is correct.  Perhaps we ought to lift the restriction 
instead based on the ID of the downstream device though.

 NB referring our earlier discussion the system in question is now at:

# uptime
 15:31:25 up 160 days,  2:58,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
# 

and the questionable link has recorded no LBMS events except for one on 
the day it was booted or maybe a day after (which I cleared back then):

# setpci -s 02:03.0 CAP_EXP+0x12.W
3012
# 

There has been some network data traffic across the link, not excessively 
high, but not insignificant either:

        RX packets 181328169  bytes 2178598128 (2.0 GiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 267194647  bytes 1149978069 (1.0 GiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 2 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

So I think we can safely conclude signalling is free from disruption at 
the electrical level and all the mess with link training at speeds beyond 
2.5GT/s is owing to some kind of a protocol interpretation issue at the 
data link layer with either or both devices, and the downstream device 
being the higher suspect based on other issues with Pericom/Diodes gear.  

 Would you agree with my conclusion?

 NB I continue being busy with other stuff, but please feel free to ping 
me directly if you need any input from me.

  Maciej
