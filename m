Lorenzo, if you have an idea how to debug this issue or if you would
like to see some test results, let me know. I can do some tests, but I
currently really do not know more then what I wrote in previous emails.

In my opinion, problem is in HW which Marvell has not documented nor
proved that it exists. Other option is that problem is in Compex card
which can be triggered only by Marvell aardvark HW.
