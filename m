I had a discussion internally about this and the prescribed usage of these APIs
seem to be that
use tegra_bpmp_transfer() in .probe() and other paths where interrupts are
enabled as this API needs interrupts to be enabled for its working.
Use tegra_bpmp_transfer_atomic() surrounded by local_irq_save()/local_irq_restore()
in other paths where interrupt servicing is disabled.
I'll go ahead and make next patch series with this if this looks fine to you.

With Bjorn's latest comment on top of this, I think we are good not to fail
the probe here.
