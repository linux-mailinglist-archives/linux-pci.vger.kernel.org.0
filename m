(1) This vaguely reminds me of
<https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=675>.


(2) I'm not 100% convinced this threat model -- I hope I'm using the
right term -- is useful. A PCI device will likely not "itself" set up
DMA (maliciously or not) without a matching driver. The driver will
likely come from the device too (option ROM). The driver will program
the device to do DMA. So, whatever the system firwmare does wrt. the
IOMMU for OS protection purposes, the device driver from the option ROM
can undo.

Is this a scenario where we trust the device driver that comes from the
device's ROM BAR (let's say after the driver passes Secure Boot
verification and after we measure it into the TPM), but don't trust the
silicon jammed in the motherboard that presents the driver?


(3) I never understood why the default behavior (or rather, "only"
behavior) for system firmware wrt. the IOMMU at EBS was "whitelist
everything". Why not "blacklist everything"?

I understand the compat perspective, but the OS should at least be able
to request such a full blackout through OsIndications or whatever. (With
the SEV IOMMU driver in OVMF, that's what we do -- we set everything to
encrypted.)

I agree.

Yes. Please see the commit message and the code comments in the
following edk2 commit:

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/7aee391fa3d0

I'm unsure how portable it is to platforms that are not derived from edk2.

Thanks!
