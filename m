Why can't you express this as a scheduling constraint when adding a new
event though? In other words:

  * If you only have a latency event, then program the latency counter and
    "reserve" HISI_PCIE_EXT_CNT
  * If you only have a packets event, then program HISI_PCIE_EXT_CNT and
    "reserve" HISI_PCIE_CNT with a dummy latency event so that HISI_PCIE_EXT_CNT
    actually counts something
  * If the user wants to count both latency and packets, then they need to
    create two events in the same group, at which point you can program
    both HISI_PCIE_CNT and HISI_PCIE_EXT_CNT and return the results in the
    two events
