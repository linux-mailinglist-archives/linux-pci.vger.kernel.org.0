Yes.

"secure" means that the Thunderbolt device that is connected can "prove"
it is the device we "authorized". It basically has a random number we
generated flashed on the NVM. This is the security "measure" used before
PC world aligned to use IOMMU instead.

(there is an explanation of all these here:
https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/thunderbolt.html#security-levels-and-how-to-use-them).

Now, in case of resume the Thunderbolt firmware is expected to connect
the PCIe tunnel before the OS gets to resume its PCIe stack but this is
not happening in this particular system when the security level is set
to "secure". It could be firmware issue, and also if the BIOS settings
get changed from the defaults it is entirely possible that the system
enters paths that are not fully validated. Yes, changing security level
should definitely work and the PCIe tunnel should be properly
established but in any case this is Thunderbolt issue not PCIe issue.

I don't recall if I suggested this already but if not, try to see there
is a firmware update for your system. Lenovo supports LVFS so if there
is newer one fwupd should allow you to upgrade it.
