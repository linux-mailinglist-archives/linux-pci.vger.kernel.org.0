We need to include some info about the problem here, e.g., the sort of
info hinted at in
https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAA85sZvJQge6ETwF1GkdvK1Mpwazh_cYJcmeZVAohmt0FjbMZg@mail.gmail.com

It would be *really* nice to have "lspci -vv" output for the system
when broken and when working correctly.  If they were attached to a
bugzilla.kernel.org entry, we could include the URL to that here.

The main point of the above is to accumulate l0s_latency_up and
l0s_latency_dw along the entire path.  I don't understand the
additional:

  if (link->aspm_capable & ASPM_STATE_L0S)

around the whole block.  I don't think it's *wrong*, but unless I'm
missing something it's unnecessary since we already check for
ASPM_STATE_L0S_UP and ASPM_STATE_L0S_DW.  It does make it arguably
more parallel with the ASPM_STATE_L1 case below, but it complicates
the diff enough that I'm not sure it's worth it.

I think this could also be split off as a separate patch to fix the
L0s latency checking.

Let's take the opportunity to update the comment to add the spec
citation for this additional 1 usec of L1 exit latency for every
switch.  I think it is PCIe r5.0, sec 5.4.1.2.2, which says:

  A Switch is required to initiate an L1 exit transition on its
  Upstream Port Link after no more than 1 Î¼s from the beginning of an
  L1 exit transition on any of its Downstream Port Links.

This accumulates the 1 usec delays for a Switch to propagate the exit
transition from its Downstream Port to its Upstream Port, but it
doesn't accumulate the L1 exit latencies themselves for the entire
path, does it?  I.e., we don't accumulate "latency" for the whole
path.  Don't we need that?
