I called it 'parent' because it is called 'parent' also in caller
function. Link consists of two devices, so 'dev' could be ambiguous.

I can change this to 'if (!ret)' if needed, no problem.

I use 'if (!val)' mostly for boolean and pointer variables. If variable
can contain more integer values then I lot of times I use '=='.

I do not know any real device which is doing this thing.

But this issue can happen with kernel's PCIe emulated root bridge:
drivers/pci/pci-bridge-emul.c

Drivers which are using this emulated root bridge (and both pci-mvebu.c
and pci-aardvark.c are using it!) do not have to implement callback for
every read and every write operation of every register.

Note that both pci-mvebu.c and pci-aardvark.c currently does not
implement access to HW register PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2. So currently it is not
possible to set PCI_EXP_LNKCTL2_TLS_2_5GT. And above code correctly
fails and disallow ASPM code to retrain link.

I have some WIP patches which implement LNKCAP2, LNKCTL2 and LNKSTA2
read/write callbacks on emulated bridge for pci-mvebu.c and
pci-aardvark.c. And I have tested that with those WIP patches ASPM code
can correctly switch link to 2.5GT/s and enable ASPM.

Ok, no problem. But then function needs to be renamed. Any idea how
should be this function called?

Ok! If needed I can reformat patch to 80 characters per line.
