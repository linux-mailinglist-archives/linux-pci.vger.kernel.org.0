I think that this is not platform specific timeout or platform specific
steps. This matches generic steps as defined in PCIe CEM spec, section
2.2.1. Initial Power-Up (G3 to S0).

What is platform specific is just how to achieve these steps.

Am I right?

...

TPVPERL is one of my timeout candidates as minimal required timeout for
Warm Reset. I have wrote it in email:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20200430082245.xblvb7xeamm4e336@pali/

But I'm not sure as specially in none diagram is described just warm
reset as defined in mPCIe CEM (3.2.4.3. PERST# Signal).

...

Anyway, I would suggest to define constants for those timeouts. I guess
that in future we could be able to define "generic" timeout constants
which would not be in private driver section, but in some common header
file.

In past Bjorn suggested to use msleep(PCI_PM_D3COLD_WAIT); macro for
this step during reviewing aardvark driver.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20190426161050.GA189964@google.com/

And next iteration used this PCI_PM_D3COLD_WAIT macro instead of 100:
