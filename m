Is there an argument *against* this patch (as opposed to "this is
probably unnecessary and it requires a lot of analysis to prove that
we don't need it")?

My biggest concern here is that there's no connection between the
VIRTFN_ID_LEN definition and the use.  Even a comment about how the
value of 16 or 17 was derived would help.
