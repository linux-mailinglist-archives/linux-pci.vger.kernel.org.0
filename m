That seems sensible. I was trying to see if we could do something
similar for Intel, and just allow anything after Skylake. I found
this[1]. It seems they have been on family 6 for a long time, and I'm
not comfortable enabling the whole family. Their model numbers also
don't seem to increment in a favorable fashion, in that "small core"
atoms (which have different host bridges with very much unknown support)
have model numbers interspersed with regular "big core" CPUS.

So we might be stuck with the Intel white list for a while, but using
the AMD family number will at least cut the number of additions down a
fair amount. I can try to put a patch together in place of this one.
