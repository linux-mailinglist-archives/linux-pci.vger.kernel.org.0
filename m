Dear Bjorn,

Thank you very much for your reply.

Yes, at the very beginning, the situation I tested was like the previous 
reply:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/bb40385c-6839-484c-90b2-d6c7ecb95ba9@163.com/


Niklas helped find the documentation description of RK3588 TRMï¼š
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/aACoEpueUHBLjgbb@ryzen/


Dear Niklas,

If I have misunderstood Bjorn's review opinion, please help me clarify 
it together. Thank you again for helping me ping the Maintainer. When I 
wanted to ping, you did it before me.

I think the above elaboration is sufficient. I will delete it.

Will change.

Will be modified.

The description is inaccurate. I will correct it.



I plan to modify the commit message as follows:
If there are any incorrect descriptions, please correct them. Thank you 
very much.

Current PCIe initialization logic may leave Root Ports operating with
non-optimal Maximum Payload Size (MPS) settings. While downstream device
configuration is handled during bus enumeration, Root Port MPS values
inherited from firmware or hardware defaults might not utilize the full
capabilities supported by the controller hardware. This can result in
suboptimal data transfer efficiency across the PCIe hierarchy.

With this patch, during the host controller probing phase and when PCIe
bus tuning is enabled, the implementation configures Root Port MPS
settings to their hardware-supported maximum values. Specifically, when
configuring the MPS for a PCIe device, if the device is a Root Port and
the bus tuning is not disabled (PCIE_BUS_TUNE_OFF), the MPS is set to
128 << dev->pcie_mpss to match the Root Port's maximum supported payload
size. The Max Read Request Size (MRRS) is subsequently adjusted by
existing logic in pci_configure_mps() to ensure it is not less than the
MPS, maintaining compliance with PCIe specifications (see PCIe r7.0,
sec 7.5.3.4).

Note that this initial setting of the Root Port MPS to the maximum might
be reduced later during the enumeration of downstream devices if any of
those devices do not support the maximum MPS of the Root Port.

Best regards,
Hans
