Sure, thatâ€™s fine. It was actually something that crossed my mind when 
I was doing this prior splitting out because I realized I still needed 
to dereference the bus and was disappointed to keep it here.

Correct the check on bridge && bridge->subordinate comes in with the 
RC_EC & RC_END

This should have happened in the â€˜bridgeâ€™ renaming patch. This was 
going to be either a reset of dev or dev->bus->self depending on the 
type via the assignment of dev = prior to renaming in (5/13). I should 
move this change back to the bridge renaming patch.
