People are reporting that pci-mvebu.c driver does not work with recent
mainline kernel. There are more bugs which prevents its for daily usage.
So lets mark it as broken for now, until somebody would be able to fix it
in mainline kernel.

Bjorn: I would really appreciate if you take this change and send it in
pull request for v6.2 release. There is no reason to wait more longer.


I'm periodically receiving emails that driver does not work correctly
anymore, PCIe cards are not detected or that they crashes during boot.

Some of the issues are handled in patches which are waiting on the list for
a long time and nobody cares for them. Some others needs investigation.

I'm really tired in replying to those user emails as I cannot do more in
this area. I have asked more people for help but either there were only
promises without any action for more than year or simple no direction how
to move forward or what to do with it.

So mark this driver as broken. Users would see the real current state
and hopefully will stop reporting me old or new bugs.
