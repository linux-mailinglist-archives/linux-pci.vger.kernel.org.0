I'd rather only add a property for things we cannot discover
ourselves. And indeed, we don't have to decide on this right now.

I sort-off guessed, as using 0 made everything work by 'magic', while
using your DT prevented the machine from booting. I tend to dislike
magic, hence this patch.

But as far as I can see, the RID-to-SID mapping is per port. So at
most, we have two RIDs per port/DART, not four. Or am I missing
something altogether?
