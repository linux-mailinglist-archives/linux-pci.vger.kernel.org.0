Does this mean we basically assume that m1n1 and early Linux boot
takes at least the 100ms T_pvperl required by CEM sec 2.2, but we take
pains to delay the 100us T_perst-clk?  That seems a little weird, but
I guess it is clear that REFCLK is *not* enabled before we enable it,
so we do need at least the 100us there.

It also niggles at me a little that the spec says T_pvperl starts from
*power stable* (not from power enable) and T_perst-clk starts from
*REFCLK stable* (not REFCLK enable).  Since we don't know the time
from enable to stable, it seems like native drivers should add some
circuit-specific constants to the spec values.

The spec doesn't say anything about what the downstream devices
support (obviously it can't because we don't *know* what those devices
are until after we enumerate them).  So to be pedantically correct,
I'd argue that we should pay attention to what the Root Port
advertises.  Of course, I don't think we do this correctly *anywhere*
today.
