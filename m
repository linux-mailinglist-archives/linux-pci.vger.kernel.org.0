Ok, that's fine, but as a "default" you should fail such that the device
is not allowed to actually do anything if 2) happens.  I think you are
doing that, it's the whole use of sysfs as the user/kernel api here in
an odd way that I am objecting to.

Agreed, but again, let's come up with a better api than "a random sysfs
file is present but reading it gets an error to convey this is an
unvalidated device" feels wrong to me.

Why not just report the "state" of the device?  You have 3 states, just
report that?  Should be much simpler overall.

Agreed, again it's the user/kernel api I am objecting to here the most.

Yes!  Or a simple "spdm_state" file that has one of these values in it?
sysfs files do not need to only return "1 or 0", they can return
different strings, but only 1 at a time.
