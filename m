My intention was that if there's any downstream device that has an
unmasked error logged and it has not reached its ratelimit, we should
log messages for all devices with errors logged.  Does something like
this help?

  /*
   * Ratelimit AER log messages.  "dev" is either the source
   * identified by the root's Error Source ID or it has an unmasked
   * error logged in its own AER Capability.  If any of these devices

   * Messages are emitted when e_info->ratelimit is non-zero.
   *
   * Note that e_info->ratelimit was already initialized to 1 for the
   * ERR_FATAL case.
   */

The ERR_FATAL case is from this post-v6 change that I haven't posted
yet:

  aer_isr_one_error(...)
  {
    ...
    if (status & PCI_ERR_ROOT_UNCOR_RCV) {
      int fatal = status & PCI_ERR_ROOT_FATAL_RCV;
      struct aer_err_info e_info = {
        ...
 +      .ratelimit = fatal ? 1 : 0;

Sharp eyes!  What do you think of this commit log text?

  The CXL pci_print_aer() case is ratelimited by the Error Source device.

  The GHES pci_print_aer() case is via aer_recover_work_func(), which
  searches for the Error Source device.  If the device is not found, there's
  no per-device ratelimit, so we use a system-wide ratelimit that covers all
  error types (correctable, non-fatal, and fatal).

This isn't really ideal because in pci_print_aer(), the struct
aer_capability_regs has already been filled by firmware and the
logging doesn't read any registers from the device at all.

However, pci_print_aer() *does* want the pci_dev for statistics and
tracing (pci_dev_aer_stats_incr()) and, of course, for the aer_printks
themselves.

We could leave this pr_err() completely alone; hopefully it's a rare
case.  I think the CXL path just silently skips pci_print_aer() if
this happens.

Eventually I would really like the native AER path to start by doing
whatever firmware is doing, e.g., fill in struct aer_capability_regs,
so the core of the AER handling could be identical between native AER
and GHES/CXL.  If we could do that, maybe we could figure out a
cleaner way to handle this corner case.
