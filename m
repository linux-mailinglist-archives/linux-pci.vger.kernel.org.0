I'm seeing no change at all in the Root Port PCIe device after the
surprise down on one of the PCIe switch downstream ports via
"lspci -vvv".

INTx works just fine for "normal" legacy interrupts, e.g. a PCIe
driver requesting a non-MSI interrupt.

Thanks Bjorn for the reference. As already mentioned to Pali in the
other mail, Bharat from Xilinx has sent me a link to a newer, updated
patch series to use this "misc" interrupts for AER in the meantime:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1542206878-24587-1-git-send-email-bharat.kumar.gogada@xilinx.com/

AFAICT, this patch series was not really reviewed. At least I can't find
any comments / replies.

I now applied this series (after some merge issues) to v5.16 and re-
tested with this new MISC interrupts for AER. Still no cigar. No
interrupt / AER event upon surprise down on the PEX switch received.

I might have missed something in the setup / configuration though. Is
my understanding correct, that I don't need to "manually" tune the SERR
in the Command register? And is my understanding correct that '0' / '-'
in the AER mask register enables this AER event?

Thanks,
Stefan
