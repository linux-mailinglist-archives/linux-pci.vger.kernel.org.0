Hello Alex? Do you have a link for this "reset" project? I'm interesting
in it as I'm dealing with Compex wifi cards which are causing problems.

For correct initialization I need to issue PCIe Warm Reset for these
cards (Warm Reset is done via PERST# pin which most linux controller
drivers controls via GPIO subsystem). And for now there is no way to
trigger PCIe Warm Reset for particular PCIe device from userspace. As
there is no userspace <--> kernel API for it.

I have tested my change. First I called 'remove' attribute for PCIe
card, then I called this 'bus_reset' on parent PCIe bridge and later I
called 'rescan' attribute on bridge. It correctly rested tested ath9k
card. So I did something similar as in above script. But I agree that
there are race conditions and basically lot of other calls needs to be
done to restore state.

So I see that to make it 'usable' we need to do it automatically in
kernel and also rescan/restore state of PCIe devices behind bridge after
reset...
