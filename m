It wouldn't be too hard to check for the NPEM capability here and 
provide access to it as well using the same LED interface, especially 
since the state bits are the same.  The module could just check for NPEM 
capability at the same time it is checking for the _DSM.  I guess that 
could be added on later without too much trouble, too... I don't think 
anything about the interface would have to change to add support for NPEM.

FWIW, it looks like NPEM support is already supported in user space in 
ledmon.  (I only wrote a kernel module for this, because it uses a _DSM 
which can't readily be accessed in user space.)

I copied the format of this output from acpi_debug_level / 
acpi_debug_layer in drivers/acpi/sysfs.c.  I thought it might be 
reasonably easy enough for a machine to parse this for the number, since 
it is always on the last line and always immediately following the only "=".

I don't object to using just a number, but I submitted an earlier 
version of this some months ago (which didn't use the LED subsystem) 
which only had the number, and Bjorn commented that decoding that was a 
bit of a pain, and that the PCI specs (which contain the bit 
definitions) isn't public.  I guess I could just add the definitions in 
the documentation if this is too verbose for sysfs.
