That's a good question and I have no idea what the answer is.
Obviously a larger LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD means less time in L1.2, but I
don't know how that translates to CPU C states.

These bugs:

  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218394
  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215832

mention C states and ASPM.  I added some of those folks to cc.

I think I'm missing your point here.  The L0s/L1 Acceptable Latencies
and the L0s/L1 Exit Latencies I see in your Win10 lspci are the same
as in Windows, which is what I would expect because these are
read-only Device and Link Capability registers and the OS can't
influence them:

  00:1d.6 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation Cannon Lake PCH PCI Express Root Port #15
    LnkCap: Port #15, Speed 8GT/s, Width x1, ASPM L0s L1, Exit Latency L0s <1us, L1 <16us

  6e:00.0 Non-Volatile memory controller: Intel Corporation Optane NVME SSD H10
    DevCap: MaxPayload 256 bytes, PhantFunc 0, Latency L0s unlimited, L1 unlimited
    LnkCap: Port #0, Speed 8GT/s, Width x2, ASPM L1, Exit Latency L1 unlimited

The DevCap L0s and L1 Acceptable Latencies are "the acceptable total
latency that an Endpoint can withstand due to transition from L0s or
L1 to L0.  It is essentially an indirect measure of the Endpoint's
internal buffering."

The LnkCap L0s and L1 Exit Latencies are the "time the Port requires
to complete transitions from L0s or L1 to L0."

I don't know how to relate LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD to L1.  I do know that
L0s and L1 were part of PCIe r2.1, but it wasn't until r3.1 that the
L1.1 and L1.2 substates were added and L1 was renamed to L1.0.  So I
expect the L1 latencies to be used to enable L1.0 by itself, and I
assume LTR and LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD are used separately to further
enable L1.2.

IIUC, LTR messages are essentially a way for the device to say "I have
enough local buffer space to hold X ns worth of traffic while I'm
waiting for the link to return to L0."

Then we should only put the link in L1.2 if we can get to L1.2 and
back to L0 in X ns or less, and LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD is basically the
minimum L0 -> L1.2 -> L0 time.

If we set LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD lower than it should be, it seems like
we're at risk of overrunning the device's local buffer.  Maybe that's
OK and the device needs to be able to tolerate that, but it does feel
risky to me.

There's also the LTR Capability that "specifies the maximum latency a
device is permitted to request.  Software should set this to the
platform's maximum supported latency or less."  Evidently drivers can
set this (only amdgpu does, AFAICS), but I have no idea how to use it.

I suppose setting it to something less than LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD might
cause L1.2 to be used more?  This would be writable via setpci, and it
looks like it can be updated any time.  If you want to play with it,
the value and scale are encoded the same way as
encode_l12_threshold(), and PCI_EXT_CAP_ID_LTR and related #defines
show the register layouts.

I don't think I would support a sysfs or similar interface to tweak
this.  Right now computing LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD already feels like a bit
of black magic, and tweaking it would be farther down the road of
"well, it seems to help this situation, but we don't really know why."
