Hello!

I'm sure it is not unique :) Just seems that these boards either do not
use device tree (x86-based) or do not have specified reset-gpios in DTS
at all.

Sometimes there is no need to touch PERST# gpio as either firmware
during boot handles it (x86 BIOS/UEFI case, or U-Boot for arm case) or
because board/cpu reset toggle PERST# in a way that is compatible for
cards init.

Looks like you have non-x86 board, which does not have PCIe init code in
firmware, needs special handling of PERST# and you are doing it with
upstream kernel :-) So maybe all these conditions are unique... But HW
design not.

As this setup with reset-gpios per card in DTS nodes is something which
I will need too, I sent email to Rob with proposal how to universally
declare it in DTS, independently of PCIe controller (you are on CC):
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20211023144252.z7ou2l2tvm6cvtf7@pali/

Due to how PCIe cards are broken, PERST# signal is sometimes the only
one option how to reset card at runtime. So requirement for separate
PERST# per card configurable at runtime by OS will be requirement for
more and more boards.
