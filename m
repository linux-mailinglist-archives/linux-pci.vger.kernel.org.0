10ms after hitting "send" it occurred to me that since all of these
quirks are for AMD devices, we could just make the quirk generic so we
wait 100ms for *all* AMD devices.  Then AMD boxes would resume a
little slower than everybody else, but some of the maintenance burden
would go away.

I'm only half joking, and I would take that patch if you sent it.
