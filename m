Tegra194 has six PCIe controllers based on Synopsys DesignWare core.
There are two Universal PHY (UPHY) blocks with each supporting 12(HSIO:
Hisg Speed IO) and 8(NVHS: NVIDIA High Speed) lanes respectively.
Controllers:0~4 use UPHY lanes from HSIO brick whereas Controller:5 uses
UPHY lanes from NVHS brick. Lane mapping in HSIO UPHY brick to each PCIe
controller (0~4) is controlled in XBAR module by BPMP-FW. Since PCIe
core has PIPE interface, a glue module called PIPE-to-UPHY (P2U) is used
to connect each UPHY lane (applicable to both HSIO and NVHS UPHY bricks)
to PCIe controller
This patch series
- Adds support for P2U PHY driver
- Adds support for PCIe host controller
- Adds device tree nodes each PCIe controllers
- Enables nodes applicable to p2972-0000 platform
- Adds helper APIs in Designware core driver to get capability regs offset
- Adds defines for new feature registers of PCIe spec revision 4
- Makes changes in DesignWare core driver to get Tegra194 PCIe working

Testing done on P2972-0000 platform
- Able to get PCIe link up with on-board Marvel eSATA controller
- Able to get PCIe link up with NVMe cards connected to M.2 Key-M slot
- Able to do data transfers with both SATA drives and NVMe cards
- Able to perform suspend-resume sequence

Note
- Enabling x8 slot on P2972-0000 platform requires pinmux driver for Tegra194.
  It is being worked on currently and hence Controller:5 (i.e. x8 slot) is
  disabled in this patch series. A future patch series would enable this.
- This series is based on top of the following series
  Jisheng's patches to add support to .remove() in Designware sub-system
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pci/list/?series=98559
  (Update: Jisheng's patches are now accepted and applied for v5.2)
  My patches made on top of Jisheng's patches to export various symbols
  http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-pci/list/?series=115671
  (Update: My above patch series is accepted and applied for v5.3)
  Another patch of mine to enable BPMP-FW resume in noirq phase
  http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1140973/
  (This is already accepted)

V15:
* Refactored pcie-tegra194.c code to call only tegra_bpmp_transfer() API
  in both .probe() path and .resume_noirq() path.

V14:
* Addressed Lorenzo's review comments in pcie-tegra194.c file (Patch 13/13)
* Added a new patch to export dw_pcie_wait_for_link() API

V13:
* Addressed Bjorn's review comments for adding Gen-4 specific defines to pci_regs.h header file

V12:
* Modified the commit message of patch-3 in this series to address review
  comments from Lorenzo

V11:
* Removed device-tree patches from the series as they are applied to relevant
  Tegra specific trees by Thierry Reding.
* Included older Tegra chips to extend quirk that disables MSI interrupt being
  used for Tegra PCIe root ports.
* Addressed review comments in P2U driver file.

V10:
* Used _relaxed() versions of readl() & writel()

V9:
* Made the drivers dependent on ARCH_TEGRA_194_SOC directly
* Addressed review comments from Dmitry

V8:
* Changed P2U driver file name from pcie-p2u-tegra194.c to phy-tegra194-p2u.c
* Addressed review comments from Thierry and Rob

V7:
* Took care of review comments from Rob
* Added a quirk to disable MSI for root ports
* Removed using pcie_pme_disable_msi() API in host controller driver

V6:
* Removed patch that exports pcie_bus_config symbol
* Took care of review comments from Thierry and Rob

V5:
* Removed redundant APIs in pcie-designware-ep.c file after moving them
  to pcie-designware.c file based on Bjorn's review comments

V4:
* Rebased on top of linux-next top of the tree
* Addressed Gustavo's comments and added his Ack for some of the changes.

V3:
* Addressed review comments from Thierry

V2:
* Addressed review comments from Bjorn, Thierry, Jonathan, Rob & Kishon
* Added more patches in v2 series
