The problem was that we didn't get these applied soon enough for them
to get any time in linux-next before the merge window opened.  I don't
like to add non-trivial things during the merge window, so I deferred
most of these.  I plan to get them in linux-next as soon as v6.10-rc1
is tagged.

If we can make a case for post-merge window fixes, e.g., to fix a
regression in the pull request or other serious issue, that's always a
possibility.
