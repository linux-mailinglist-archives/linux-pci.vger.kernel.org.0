I should have described why this patch is introdcued.
do_pci_disable_device clears the Bus Master Enable bit just like what
__pci_set_master does which is kind of duplications.  Also,
__pci_set_master has debug print log which is useful for users to figure
out whether bus master is set or cleared.  This patch makes
do_pci_disable_device call __pci_set_master to take the debug log
advantages and make code cleaner by clearing duplicated codes.
