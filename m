Yes, sorry about the thread. It's probably something I did.

Thanks for the information.

The AER errors are caused by ASPM. If I disable power management then 
they go away. The hard lockups still occur though so it seems like it 
might be a separate issue.

Obviously the chipset is buggy but I'm trying to work around it as best 
I can. I may just have to add a quirk and disable MMCONFIG for this 
chipset (if that's possible).
