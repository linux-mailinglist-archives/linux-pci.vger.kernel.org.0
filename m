Some enclosures may support just one blinky state at a time. Other
implementations might have multiple LEDs and colors, so you could, for
example, "locate" something that is also "failed", with both states
visible simultaneously. You could capture the current states with the
"scheduler" type display, but setting new states may be more
complicated.
