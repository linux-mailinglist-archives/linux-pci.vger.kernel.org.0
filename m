"Type 1" has two specific meanings in PCI, and neither is quite this
config access mechanism:

  1) "Type 0 Functions" have a "Type 0 Configuration Space Header" --
     these are basically endpoint devices.  "Type 1" Functions have
     Type 1 headers and are PCI-to-PCI bridges (Root Ports, Switches,
     Bridges in PCIe).

  2) "Type 0" config transactions target a device on the current bus,
     i.e., the recipient does not need to decode the bus number in the
     transaction.  A "Type 1" config transaction needs to be routed
     through one or more bridges.  The last bridge, where the bus
     number in the transaction matches the bridge's secondary bus
     number, converts the transaction to a Type 0 transaction on its
     secondary bus.

The "CAM" devices that use a 16-bit shift for the bus number are sort
of similar to the "Configuration Mechanism #1" description in PCI
r3.0, sec 3.2.2.3.2, but it's not really a good match because they
don't implement the x86-specific parts like I/O port registers at
0xcf8 and 0xcfc.  Also, that mechanism only allows access to the first
256 bytes of config space, and some/all of these extend the address
format so they can address extended config space (offsets
0x100-0xfff).
