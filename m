Yes, pci_upstream_bridge(dev) returns NULL if dev is on a root bus.
I think bus->self is NULL for root buses anyway, so I think this patch
is OK at least at this point in the series.

Well, I think we're at least no worse than today.  Today we keep
"bridge == dev" for Root Ports and Downstream Ports, and use
"bridge = dev->bus->self" for everything else.

After this series we keep "bridge == dev" for RCEC and RCiEPs in
addition.

I'm not sure about PCI_EXP_TYPE_PCI_BRIDGE, which is a PCIe-to-PCI
bridge.  According to the ancient "PCI Express to PCI/PCI-X Bridge
Specification" r1.0 of July 14, 2003, sec 5.23, these bridges can have
an AER Capability (with different format that I don't see mentioned
elsewhere).

But this AER Capability doesn't have the Root registers, so I assume
it would have to be below a Root Port in order to actually signal the
errors, which would mean it could not be on a root bus.

So I don't really *love* the fact that we use pci_upstream_bridge()
and rely on these assumptions that the result will not be NULL, but I
guess it's OK for now.
