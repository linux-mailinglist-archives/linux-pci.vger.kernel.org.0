Hi Marc,

Thank you for the review.

Split up in v2.

Fixed in v2.

Relaxed accessors are used throughout in v2... it Works For Meâ„¢ but no
guarantees I didn't introduce a race...

I'm not sure. Sven, any idea how Apple devices are usually structured here?

Done in v2.

Sven's explanation is the most likely. This magic value comes from
Corellium via Mark; I assume it's written by macOS.

I reordered the code to have the configuration after this happen before the START command as suggested (this works), and then removed the poll entirely (this also works?). It's possible the poll here was just a debug leftover in the original code. It's possible it's needed in the original but not needed in the interrupt-driven common code (if the link doesn't come up yet, nothing happens, so we don't have to block on it ourselves..)

It's also possible I've introduced a race that we happen to win every time.

Without specs, it's exceedingly hard to know which it is...

The poll isn't what we want at any rate, so I've removed the poll in v2. But we
may want extra interrupt handling code for v3.

Fixed in v2.
