I looked into it Thomas.  The issue is as you suggested early in the
thread.  If an IRQ arrives at line N of a non-primary IO-APIC and that
line is masked, a new IRQ is generated on the primary IO-APIC/PIC.  

The BIOS setting to address this forwarding is as above Disable INTx
Route to PCH/ICH/SouthBridge. When this bit is set, local INTx messages
received from the PCI-E ports are not routed to legacy PCH - they are
either converted into MSI via the integrated I/OxAPIC (if the I/OxAPIC
mask bit is clear in the appropriate entries) or cause no further
action (when mask bit is set).

This capability is tested and supported fully on Intel platforms.

For example, 5520 [1], Xeon E5 4600  [2] , Xeon E7 [3], and so on
include this bit :
 
[1] 
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/5520-5500-chipset-ioh-datasheet.pdf
page 139
[2] 
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/xeon-e5-1600-2600-vol-2-datasheet.pdf
, page 280
[3] 
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/xeon-e7-v2-datasheet-vol-2.pdf
, page 373
etc..

Once you get to SKX/CLX things change and integrated IOxAPICs in the
IIO module convert legacy PCI Express interrupt messages into MSI
interrupts directly.  Beyond SKX/CLX there are no longer IOxAPICs in
IIO. IOxAPIC is only in the PCH. Devices connected to the
IIO will use native MSI/MSI-x mechanisms.

The problem is with the absolute lack of useful documentation.  Thatâ€™s
not acceptable.  

You recall the work Olaf and Stefan did at SuSE ten years ago (?) on
boot irq quirks and the amount of research they had to do it learn
about the behavior.[4]

From a Real-Time Linux perspective this is really important to me.  As
we get closer to fully mainlined we need to have this information
readily available with greater usage of threaded irqs in combination
with legacy interrupts on the older platforms.

So I will ensure we actually create useful information pointing to this
behavior either in kernel docs or online as in a white paper or both.

Agreed, and I will follow-up with Kar Hin Ong to get them added.
