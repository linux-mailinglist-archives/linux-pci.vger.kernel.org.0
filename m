Hello! Due to no other comments or reactions in this area for one month,
I will briefly send Orion patches with definitions as they are. config
space registers are accessed in the same way as internal registers, they
are memory based and per port specific. Trying to do it differently
hardly does not work as kernel PCI core code has expectations what can
be stored in ranges= and reg= properties - and this cannot not (and also
should not) be changed in PCI core code for good reasons.
