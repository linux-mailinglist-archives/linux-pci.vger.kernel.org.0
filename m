After suspend, I assumed that there won't be any access to the controller
specific registers, so thought it should be fine. And it works on X13s too.
Maybe, the access to device config space is triggering issues on CRD? I will
check with Qcom.

Thanks for testing, Johan!

I did not test this on CRD. Since both X13s and CRD are sharing the same
SoC, I thought it would work on CRD too. But since you have tested and
reported the issue, I will look into it.

Yeah, this seems to be a platform issue. I will check on this behaviour and
report back.

Thanks,
Mani
