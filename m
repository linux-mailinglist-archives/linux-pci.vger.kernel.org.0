The "untrusted" means the device is something that is not "soldered
down" or equivalent. E.g something you can hot-plug through a port on the
laptop system such as USB4/TB. It is used to enable full IOMMU mappings
for these devices to avoid malicious devices from accessing memory that
does not belong to it.

So it is pretty much same as "removable".

Why we do want to have the USB4 host controller + xHCI not "untrusted"
is because they don't need to go through the full IOMMU mappings and
therefore we get for one more throughput for things like networking over
USB4.

I think they should be the "same".

You can add something like "Suggested-by" or so if you like but up to
you. No need to add other tags from me.

Please Cc IOMMU folks too so that they can take a look just in case.

The patch is line-wrapped but otherwise looks good except the above.
Thanks for cleaning it up.
