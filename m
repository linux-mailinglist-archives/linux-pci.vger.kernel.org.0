I will let fixing those issues to Marek.

To answer your questions: Config space of Aardvark Root Port does not
conform to PCIe base spec. It does not implement DLLLARC, nor DLLSCE and
lot of other bits. Plus it has Type 0 header (not Type 1). And due to
these reasons, pci-aardvark.c driver implements "emulation" of the
Root Port and implements some of the functionality via custom aardvark
registers. So Root Port would be presented to kernel and also to
userspace as PCI Bridge device with Type 1 header and with PCIe
registers required by linux kernel.

During my testing of kernel hotplug code last year, I figured out that
kernel was waiting for event which never happened. And so it was needed
to "fix" kernel to not try to enable DLLSCE because it did nothing.

I asked more times Marvell for Aardvark documentation, so I could fix
these issues, but I have never received any response for it.

At time when I prepared this patch (year ago) I changed that DLLSCE
pattern in all places because it looked like copy+paste code which
should be fixed too.
