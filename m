With bad uboot (which enumerates and initialize all PCIe devices,
including that memory controller), linux kernel is unable to use PCIe
devices. E.g. ath10k driver fails to start. If bad uboot has disabled
PCIe device initialization then kernel has no problems.

There are 3 independent links from CPU, so 3 independent buses. Buses 01
and 02 are accessed directly, not via bus 00.

Linux devices 00:01.0, 00:02.0 and 00:03.0 are just virtual devices
created by kernel pci-bridge-emul.c driver. They are not real devices,
they are not present on PCIe bus and therefore they cannot be visible or
available in u-boot.

Moreover kernel pci-mvebu.c controller driver filters exactly one device
at every bus which results that "memory controller" is not visible in
lspci.

Moreover there is mvebu specific register which seems to set device
number on which is present this "memory controller". U-Boot sets this
register to zero, so at XX:00.00 is "memory controller" and on XX:01.00
is wifi card. Kernel sets this register to one, so at XX:01.00 is
"memory controller" and on XX:00.00 is wifi card. Kernel then filter
config read/write access to BDF XX:01.YY address.

This is just coincidence that memory controller visible in PCIe config
space has same PCI device id as virtual root bridge emulated by kernel
pci-bridge-emul.c driver. These are totally different devices.

This is ordinary PCIe wifi card. It does not have integrated Root
Complex. Moreover that "memory controller" device is visible (in u-boot)
also when I disconnect wifi card.

This matches linux lspci output, just first bus is indexed from zero
instead of one. In linux it is indexed from one because at zero is that
fake/virtual bridge device emulated by linux kernel.

Does it make a little more sense now?
