So is there some user-level software that runs between the removal and
re-enumeration?  Something that authorizes the 07:00.0 Upstream Port?

I think you have suggested a firmware update, but I don't think that's
a great solution for most users.  An ordinary user who has the
security level set to "secure" and updates to a v6.4 kernel is just
going to think resume is broken.  That user will not be willing or
able to diagnose it as a security setting that could be changed or
firmware that could be updated.

It would be ideal if we could make "secure" resume as fast as "user"
resume, but at the very least, I think we need to make it no worse
than it was in v6.3.
