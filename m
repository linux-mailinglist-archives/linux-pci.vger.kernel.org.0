What you are trying to achieve with this patch now? Do you think that it
is really correct to show that everything is working for everybody
correctly? Use a common sense here.

Or this is a way how kernel people are fixing bugs?

Now I'm starting understand why majority of HW industry say to not use
"unsupported mainline kernel" and instead use our prepared patched
kernels...
