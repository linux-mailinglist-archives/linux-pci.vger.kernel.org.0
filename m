tl;dr

- Mysterious Marvell Memory Controller is PCIe Root Port (it can be
  verified by e.g. doing config space dump from U-Boot and then parse
  it via lspci)
- Config space of this PCIe device is mapped directly to the address
  space of PCIe controller (to offset zero)
- It has config space with Header Type 0 and Class Code 0x5080
- BARs configure PCIe controller itself, BAR0 must point to beginning of
  the SoC registers, other BARs to DDR memory address space
- Both U-Boot and Kernel pci mvebu drivers set Secondary Bus num to zero
- Patch which was fixing this issue disappeared from kernel

I think this explains all mentioned issues in previous email. Controller
driver configures registers for SoC and DDR and then PCI core/pnp
reconfigured them via config space to different values = no PCIe device
is working as PCIe controller it not able to access SoC registers and
DDR memory correctly anymore.

Bjorn, it is normal that PCIe Root Port device has Type 0 config space
and Class Code 0x5080 (Memory controller)? Because I thought that PCIe
Root Port device must have Class Code 0x6004 (PCI Bridge) with Type 1
config space.

And what should happen according to PCIe standards when both primary and
secondary bus numbers are configured to zeros? Or to other same numbers?

On primary bus is that Memory Controller == Root Port and on secondary
bus is endpoint card. Marvell has additional register for specifying
device number at which Root Port appears. And it looks like that if
primary and secondary bus numbers are same, then on this bus at Root
Port device address appears Root Port and on all other device addresses
appears endpoint card (which looks crazy if endpoint card is at all
possible BDF addresses where B=primary=secondary and D!=root_port).
But I have no idea what happens for other buses.

Seems that due to these issues pci-mvebu.c kernel driver filters access
to this PCIe Root Port device and uses pci-bridge-emul.c for providing
emulated PCIe Root Port device. It sets Root Port device address to 1
and allow access only to device address 0 (at which is endpoint card).

This issues appears in all Marvell SoCs. Here are just few lspci output
sent by different people in past. And All have one common thing: device
with "Root Port" and "Memory controller: Marvell" marking:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/alpine.DEB.2.02.1210261857100.20029@mirri/
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/ad9478410910120746g2ce82af1t71a84ea02e9eecb7@mail.gmail.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/ath9k-devel/4FF0EBCE.3020308@allnet.de/

And that is not all. It looks like that this issue with Root Port /
Memory Controller was known also for kernel developers. In past, about
10 years ago, into kernel was merged following commit which explained it
and fixed class code from Memory Controller to PCI Bridge:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1dc831bf53fddcc6443f74a39e72db5bcea4f15d

Apparently this patch completely disappeared as I'm not able find any
code with this comment or fixup in mainline kernel anymore.
Bjorn, Lorenzo, do you have any idea what happened?
