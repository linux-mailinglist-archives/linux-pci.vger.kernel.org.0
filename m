Add support for PCIe controllers that can operate in endpoint mode
in Tegra194.

Signed-off-by: Vidya Sagar <vidyas@nvidia.com>

V2:
* Addressed Thierry's review comments
* Merged EP specific information from tegra194-pcie-ep.txt to tegra194-pcie.txt itself
* Started using the standard 'reset-gpios' for PERST GPIO
* Added 'nvidia,refclk-select-gpios' to enable REFCLK signals
