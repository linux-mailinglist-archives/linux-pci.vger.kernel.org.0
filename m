If you look at the commit message in patch 1/2, the whole reason for this
series is that someone has seen an issue :)

While I personally haven't seen any issue, the user reporting that commit
ec9fd499b9c6 ("PCI: dw-rockchip: Don't wait for link since we can detect
Link Up") regressed his system so that it can no longer mount rootfs
(which is on a PLEXTOR PX-256M8PeGN NVMe SSD) clearly has seen an issue.

It is possible that his device is not following the spec.
I simply compared the code before and after ec9fd499b9c6, to try to
figure out why it was actually working before, and came up with this,
which made his device functional again.

Perhaps we should add a comment above the sleep that says that this
should strictly not be needed as per the spec?
(And also add the same comment in the (single) controller driver in
mainline which already does an msleep(PCIE_T_RRS_READY_MS).)


Kind regards,
Niklas
