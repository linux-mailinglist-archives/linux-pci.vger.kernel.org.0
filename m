Oh, I forgot how VMD works.  It sounds like there *is* a Root Port
that is logically below the VMD, e.g., (from
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215027):

  ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PC00] (domain 0000 [bus 00-e0])
  acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: platform does not support [AER]
  acpi PNP0A08:00: _OSC: OS now controls [PCIeHotplug SHPCHotplug PME PCIeCapability LTR]
  pci  0000:00:0e.0: [8086:467f] type 00         # VMD
  vmd  0000:00:0e.0: PCI host bridge to bus 10000:e0
  pci 10000:e0:06.0: [8086:464d] type 01         # Root Port to [bus e1]
  pci 10000:e1:00.0: [144d:a80a] type 00         # Samsung NVMe

So ERR_* messages from the e1:00.0 Samsung device would terminate at
the e0:06.0 Root Port.  That Root Port has an AER Capability with Root
Error Command/Status/Error Source registers.

So I think the question is whether that PNP0A08:00 _OSC applies to
domain 10000.  I think the answer is "no" because the platform doesn't
know about the existence of domain 10000, and it can't access config
space in that domain.

E.g., if _OSC negotiated that the platform owned AER in domain 0000, I
don't think it would make sense for that to mean the platform *also*
owned AER in domain 10000, because the platform doesn't know how to
configure AER or handle AER interrupts in that domain.

Nirmal's patch ignores _OSC for hotplug, but keeps the _OSC results
for AER, PME, and LTR.  I think we should ignore _OSC for *all* of
them.

That would mean reverting 04b12ef163d1 ("PCI: vmd: Honor ACPI _OSC on
PCIe features") completely, so of course we'd have to figure out how
to resolve the AER message flood a different way.
