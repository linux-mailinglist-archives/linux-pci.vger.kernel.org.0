I'm dropping this because of the required delay pointed out by Lukas.

If you think we still need to do something here, please clarify the
situation.  Are you hot-adding?  Hot-swapping?  Since you mention a
protocol timeout, I suspect the latter, e.g., maybe you had an
existing device with connections already open, and you want to replace
it with a new device while preserving those open connections?

We do have to preserve the existing user experience, e.g., delays to
allow operators to recover from mistaken latch opens or button
presses.  But if we knew more about what you're trying to do, maybe we
could figure out another approach.
