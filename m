Ok, so then this is question for Broadcom. Without spec we probably
cannot do anything.

This is core specific exception and for A53 it means AXI Slave Error.
I guess that on A72 it could mean too. But generally for Aarch64 they
are not defined.

We are not checking them because it is asynchronous exception. You do
not know who, when and why caused this exception. Exception may come
also after executing lot of other instructions. It is non-recoverable
fatal exception and it means something like internal core error. The
only reasonable thing to do is to reset CPU.

CPU should not receive AXI Slave Error under non-fatal condition and it
is basically bug in that PCIe controller that it sends such thing to
the CPU core. PCIe controller should for ECAM load/store operations
always returns AXI Slave OK response and on error it should set all-ones
in data part.

The proper way is to find out if PCIe controller does not have some
hidden or debug register which allows to disable sending these errors.
IIRC DesignWare has it, so there is big chance that Broadcom has it too.
But for example Cadence does not have it (yet).

Other way is map ECAM address memory space in strong ordering mode.
It would cause CPU core to wait during executing of load / store
operation after they completely finish and then AXI Slave Error is
reported as synchronous exception as Data Abort, which is possible.
On ARMv7 it was possible by marking mapping as Device. On ARMv8 it
should be possible too, but on A53 it is unimplemented. Maybe possible
on A72? But it is kind like a hack to workaround total mess.

I will send separate email to Broadcom people who already helped with
one of their PCIe controller in the past. Maybe there is hidden register
debug bit which can turn it off.

The main issue is that nobody had analyzer for doing it, it is not a
cheap device.
