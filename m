This whole discussion is about who *owns* the feature, not whether the
hardware supports the feature.

The general rule is "if _OSC covers the feature, the platform owns the
feature and the OS shouldn't touch it unless the OS requests and is
granted control of it."

VMD wants special treatment, and we'd like a simple description of
what that treatment is.  Right now it sounds like you want the OS to
own *hotplug* below VMD regardless of what _OSC says.

But I still have no idea about other features like AER, etc., so we're
kind of in no man's land about how to handle them.
