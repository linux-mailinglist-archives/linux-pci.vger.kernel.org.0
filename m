Thanks. I will add it to the commit message.

I don't think that any PCIÂ  driver writer can answer this question for
sure.

I can however confirm that this driver, on the a385, works with no
u-boot PCIe initialization. As for other subsystems PCI is dependent on
(e.g. SerDes, etc), I can't say for sure.
