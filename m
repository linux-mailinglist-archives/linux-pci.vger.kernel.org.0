Thanks. Turns out I still receive e-mail sent to @free-electrons.com,
so I had seen your previous e-mail but didn't had the chance to reply.

To be honest, I don't have much details about what this device does,
and my memory is unclear on whether I really ever had any details. I
vaguely remember that this is a device that made sense when the Marvell
PCIe controller is used as an endpoint, and in such a situation this
device also the root complex to "see" the physical memory of the
Marvell SoC. And therefore in a situation where the Marvell PCIe
controller is the root complex, seeing this device didn't make sense.

In addition, I /think/ it was causing problems with the MBus windows
allocation. Indeed, if this device is visible, then we will try to
allocate MBus windows for its different BARs, and those windows are in
limited number.

I know this isn't a very helpful answer, but the documentation on this
is pretty much nonexistent, and I don't remember ever having very
solid and convincing answers.

I've added in Cc Stefan Chulski, from Marvell, who has recently posted
patches on the PPv2 driver. I don't know if he will have details about
PCIe, but perhaps he will be able to ask internally at Marvell.

Best regards,

Thomas
