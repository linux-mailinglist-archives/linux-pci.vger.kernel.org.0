Hello world!\n

I released version 3.7.0 of the pciutils.

From the changelog:

	* Released as 3.7.0.

	* Added or improved the following capabilities: Designated Vendor-Specific,
	  Compute eXpress Link, Resizable BARs, VF Resizable BARs, Link
	  Capabilities 2, Link Status 2.

	* On Linux, lspci can show IOMMU groups.

	* setpci can be asked to skip bus scan and operate on a device
	  completely specified by its domain/bus/dev/func address. This
	  involved major internal cleanup.

	* The above feature of setpci uses the pci_get_dev() function,
	  which obtains a struct pci_dev without doing a bus scan. This was
	  always possible, but apparently little used, because back-ends
	  frequently choked when operating on such devices. Fixed a lot
	  of minor bugs related to this.

	* Also, back-ends which do not support domains now correctly fail when
	  trying to access devices outside domain 0.

	* Semantics of pci_fill_info() and pci_dev->known_fields was underspecified,
	  which lead to inconsistencies between back-ends. Improved documentation
	  to give a more precise definition and updated all back-ends to conform
	  to it. Most importantly, pci_dev->known_fields shows all fields requested
	  over the lifetime of the pci_dev, but never those which are not supported
	  by the back-end.

	* As usually, updated pci.ids to the current snapshot of the database.

If you are aware of a patch which was not merged, please let me know.

				Have a nice fortnight
