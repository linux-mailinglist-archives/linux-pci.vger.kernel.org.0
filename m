As far as I can tell current_state is normally guarded by the device
lock, but here we don't hold that lock. I generally prefer to be
explicit about those kinds of access, if only to document that the value
can change here.

In this case it should work fine without it, but this also has the
benefit that if someone were to add a change like

   if (state > x)
           state = y;

later on (here or even in pci_power_name() due to inlining), things
wouldn't break as we explicitly forbid the compiler to load
current_state more than once. Without the READ_ONCE, the compiler would
be theoretically allowed to do two separate reads then (although
arguably unlikely it would end up doing that).

Also there's no downside of marking it as READ_ONCE here as far as I can
tell, as in that context the value will always have to be loaded from
memory.

So in short, mostly personal preference rooted in documentation and
avoiding potential (unlikely) future mishaps.

Regards,
Max
