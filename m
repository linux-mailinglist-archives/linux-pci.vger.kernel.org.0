What does this series apply to?  I default to the current -rc1
(v6.14-rc1), but this doesn't apply there, and I don't have the
base-commit: aae0594a7053c60b82621136257c8b648c67b512 mentioned in the
cover letter.

Sometimes things make more sense when I can see everything as applied.

The dependency on pdev being an endpoint is not clear here, so I would
just remove the check altogether or move it to the place that breaks
if pdev is not an endpoint.

A typedef would be fine with me.

Unless there are CXL non-protocol errors that need to be
distinguished, I would just omit "prot" altogether.

What's the name of the corresponding CPER struct?

It seems weird to me to have two device pointers here.  Seems like we
should use a single pointer to identify the device, and if we need to
get from PCI to CXL or vice versa, there should be a pointer somewhere
so we don't have to search all the time.

Passing around ras_base seems dodgy to me.  I think it's better to
pass around a real entity like a pci_dev or cxl_port or cxl_dport or
whatever.  Code that needs to deal with ras_base presumably should
know about the internals of the device ras_base belongs to.
