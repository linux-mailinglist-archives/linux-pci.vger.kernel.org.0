 I think it doesn't really matter, because in a correctly operating system 
LBMS is not supposed to be set at the point `pcie_failed_link_retrain' is 
called in the first place.  We don't want to respond to LBMS being set 
just as a consequence of writing 1 to the Retrain Link bit, because it is 
always set in this scenario even for open links and we know we've did the 
retraining anyway, so we can communicate it via other means if we need to.

 Yes, and it is an intended effect.  We only want to trigger for LBMS set 
by hardware in an attempt to correct unreliable link operation.

 I look forward to the outcome of your effort.  I expect you'll remove 
this part then and handle the clearing of the LBMS bit in the bandwidth 
controller interrupt handler.
