Thanks for the explanations, I think I get it a bit better now. But I still
think we should be exposing both of the values to userspace instead of
reporting the ratio from which the individual counters are then
unrecoverable.

It will complicate the driver slightly, but can we instead expose the
events independently and then allowing scheduling some of them in groups?

That way we just treat HISI_PCIE_CNT and HISI_PCIE_EXT_CNT as separate
counters, but with a scheduling constraint that events in a register pair
must be in the same group.
