Happy to add that, no problem, but:

  - "Signed-off-by" has a specific meaning about either being involved
    in the creation of the patch or being part of the chain of
    transmitting the patch, see
    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst?id=v6.6#n396
    Since I got the patch directly from you, adding a signed-off-by
    from dima@ would mean he created part of the patch.

  - I don't think it makes sense to include both Signed-off-by and
    Reviewed-by from the same person, since the point of Reviewed-by
    is to get review by somebody other than the author.

  - dima@ should include a name as well as the email address (I assume
    "Dmitry Safonov <dima@arista.com>")

So if you want to use a Signed-off-by from Dmitry, please post a v4
including that (ideally starting from the commit above because I
silently fixed a couple other typos (although I missed the
put_device() thing)).

If you prefer a Dmitry's Reviewed-by, no need to post a v4.  The best
thing would be for Dmitry to respond with the Reviewed-by on the
mailing list.  Some people do collect reviews internally, but I prefer
to get them directly from the reviewer.

Bjorn
