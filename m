I think that your patch is doing also something different. It uses
PERST# signal to reset card _after_ card was fully powered on and
_maybe_ link was already established (depends on bootloader if it
initialized PCIe, etc...).

Important is that this reset is really needed for some cards (e.g. lot
of Atheros wifi cards as they can be stuck somewhere in broken state)
and I do not think it is Tpvperl delay. More controller drivers add some
delay between flipping PERST# signal. In past I wrote summary of it:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20200424092546.25p3hdtkehohe3xw@pali/

But there is minimal value for Tperst-clk which is 100us defined in PCIe
CEM spec (3.0) and also in M.2 CEM spec.

For power-on it is probably overkill, but I think that delay between
flipping PERST# should be there. IIRC Compex WLE1216 wifi card needs to
be at least 10-11ms in reset. Last year, during testing of this card I
saw that if PERST#-based reset was shorter then card was completely
undetected.

My opinion is that this patch does not power on/off card in PCIe slot.
And because card is powered-on for a long time (as you wrote), it means
that Tpvperl delay does not apply here. That is why I think that
different delay (How long should be PCIe card in Warm Reset state)
should be used _between_ flipping PERST# signal.

And of course after the releasing PERST# that 100ms post-PERST# delay is
required.

I have an idea to move PERST# handling (with all delays) from controller
drivers to pci core functions. Because basically every driver
re-implements these delays in its probe function. I wrote this idea with
some details in email. If you have a time, could you look at it? I
summarized here also details about delays (like Tpvperl, Tperstclk, ..):
