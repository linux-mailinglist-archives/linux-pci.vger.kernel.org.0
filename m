I can only second this. It is much better to have a generic block
implementing MSI *in a non multiplexed way*, for multiple reasons:

- the interrupt vs DMA race that Ard mentions above,

- MSIs are very often used to describe the state of per-CPU queues. If
  you multiplex MSIs behind a single multiplexing interrupt, it is
  always the same CPU that gets interrupted, and you don't benefit
  from having multiple queues at all.

Even if you have to implement the support as a bunch of wired
interrupts, there is still a lot of value in keeping a 1:1 mapping
between MSIs and wires.

Thanks,
