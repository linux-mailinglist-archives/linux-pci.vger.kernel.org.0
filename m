The fact that it is common doesn't make it less broken. Also, 32
interrupts from the same device, all squashed behind a single global
IRQ seems pretty unhelpful.

A driver is allowed to call disable_irq() at any time. Not
implementing this breaks drivers. You may not care for a particular
application, but that is still broken in general.

Of course, you could rely on the device only supporting Multi-MSI
(which is what you seem to have), in which case you can disable
interrupts for the whole device. Goodbye performance.

The irq_chip only deals with individual interrupts, and has no
callbacks for global settings. You will have to keep your global
settings for things that are global, such as probe and resume.
