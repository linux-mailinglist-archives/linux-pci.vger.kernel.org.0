Absolutely agree that checking on reset.  There will be cases where it has
to be mediated by firmware of some type, as same DOE can be in use for IDE
which may well be controlled by an entity other than the kernel.  However,
there are other cases where the kernel will probably want to do it directly
- particularly as CMA can exist for VFs. From the ECN:

"In other use cases it may be desirable to evaluate individual Functions.
 For example, when a Function is directly assigned to a Virtual Machine
 (VM) that VM can use CMA via DOE to confirm that the hardware element
 assigned to it meets the VMâ€™s requirements. For such use cases, the
 security exchange with the individual Function is not required to match
 identically the results received from other Functions."

You also raise the question of measurement management which is still very
much on the todo list. I'll add that to the cfp proposal as possible
discussion topic.  My assumption so far is it will look very much like IMA
but I've not gotten down to the details.
