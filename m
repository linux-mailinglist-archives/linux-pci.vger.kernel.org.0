Sorry for the delay in responding.  Coincidentally, part of the reason
is that I've been consumed with some PCI Firmware spec updates related
to _DSM, which actually happens to affect this code.

_DSM is defined in the public ACPI spec; see ACPI v6.3, sec 9.1.1.
One problem with this interface is that it does not define any
standard return type or value, so there is no way to tell from the
return value whether the function is implemented.  That means I don't
think it's safe to rely on "!obj" meaning "DSM_PCI_LTR_MAX_LATENCY
isn't implemented".  Similarly, I don't think it's safe to assume
"obj" means it *is* implemented.

We have lots of places in the kernel that do this wrong.  One that
does it *right* is acpi_dpc_port_get().  Short story: we need to call
acpi_check_dsm() first before calling acpi_evaluate_dsm().

There's an ongoing discussion about what *revision* we should use.
For now I think the right thing is to use 2 as you did, since that's
the first revision where DSM_PCI_LTR_MAX_LATENCY is defined.  I would
use "2" (decimal) like the other uses in the file, though.

Nit: sort the declarations in order of use, i.e., endpoint_dev, ltr, ...

dev->max_snoop_latency and dev->max_nosnoop_latency are not simple
scalars, are they?  Aren't they 3 bits of scale and 10 bits of value?
I don't think adding these is as easy as "+=" except in the simple
case when the scale is "000", i.e., "use the 10 bits of value as-is".

I think we have to decode scale * latency for each device in the path,
add all those up, then re-encode using the appropriate scale for the
config write below.

I think we definitely need to do this, but we need to be careful about
updating things here, since I suspect mistakes will cause
hard-to-debug problems.  PCIe r5.0, sec 6.18, says:

  Setting the value and scale fields to all 0â€™s indicates that the
  device will be impacted by any delay and that the best possible
  service is requested.

If I understand that correctly, larger values for these registers
indicate that the device can tolerate more latency, so we want to err
on the side of setting these fields too low rather than too high.

So I think maybe we should read the current values first.  If the
value we computed is the same, we can just skip the write.

What should we do if the value we computed is *larger* than the
current value?  Hot-added devices will power up with zeroes here, so I
think we probably should log a note (pci_info()) and do the write.  If
we don't do the write and we enable ASPM, LTR, and L1 Substates, the
zeroes mean the device will be requesting the best possible service,
so we won't use the L1.2 substate as much as we should, resulting in
more power consumption than necessary.

If we read something non-zero, it probably means firmware has already
configured this.  If we computed something larger, we should probably
still log a message, but maybe skip the write.  My thinking is that
this may be a firmware bug, and fixing it could reduce power usage.
If we do the write, we risk breaking something that used to work.

If the value we computed is *smaller* than the current value, I think
we should log a note just to show that we're changing something, and
we *should* do the write, because writing a smaller value should
always be safe.

The log messages should include both the current value and the new
value we computed (decoded so they're easy to read and compare).
