I'm hoping that Thierry's proposal can be made to work out, since it's 
closer to how the ACPI version should work, which means we would be able 
to do a lot more in shared common code rather than baking magic 
knowledge and duplicated functionality into individual IOMMU drivers.

Ah, from the context I missed that that was non-modular and relying on 
initcall trickery... fair enough, in that case I'll downgrade my "it's 
insufficient" to "it's ugly and somewhat fragile" :P

Thanks,
Robin.
