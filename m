I think the correct setting for this is to have it disabled. This means
it is native PCIe with the runtime D3 support and looking at the ACPI
dump you shared this seems to be the case.

I did not find anything "unusual" in the ACPI dump but I keep looking.

One thing I noticed, probably has nothing to do with this, but you have
the "security level" set to "secure". Now this is fine and actually
recommended but I wonder if anything changes if you switch that
temporarily to "user"? What is happening here is that once the system
enters S3 the Thunderbolt driver tells the firmware to save the
connected device list, and then once it exits S3 it is expected to
re-connect the PCIe tunnels of the devices on that list but this is not
happening and that's why the dock "dissappears" during resume.

In any case we can conclude that the commit in question has nothing to
do with the issue. This is completely Thunderbolt related problem.
