No, I'm saying the closest this should come to DT at all is the 
possibility of the low-level driver hard-coding a platform-specific 
value for pp->msi_data based on some platform-specific compatible, as 
Serge pointed to on v1.

Otherwise, based on the system memory layout and dma-ranges of the 
controller node we have enough information to figure out what PCI bus 
address ranges can't collide with any valid DMA mapping of RAM, and thus 
generate a suitable MSI address, but that really wants to be a generic 
PCI-layer helper (which could also generically implement the various DMA 
API tricks as a fallback if necessary).

Thanks,
Robin.
