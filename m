Hi,

Thank you for sending the patch over!

By the way, this is v2?  If so, then it would be "[PATCH v2]", but not
a big deal.

A few nitpicks.

It would be "PCIe" not "pcie", and "Samsung" and "Realtek" so that these
are properly capitalised.

Normally, the time stamp is better removed as it's not very useful.

[...]

Again, it would be "PCIe" here.  Also, since you are mentioning the PCI
specification, would you be able to provide either a quote or a location
(standard revision, chapter, page, etc.) from the PCI SIG?

Additionally, if this change fixes a previous commit, then it might be
prudent to include the "Fixes:" field referring to it, as it's customary
to do so - a link to a relevant Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/)
would also be fine, if there is anything.

Other than that,
