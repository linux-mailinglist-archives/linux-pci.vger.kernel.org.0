The HW showed up, alright: it's the IBM Power 9, which provides HW-based
memory coherency between its CPUs and GPUs. So on this system, the CPU is
allowed to access GPU memory, which *could* be modeled as DEVICE_PUBLIC.

However, what happened was that the system worked well enough with a combination
of the device driver, plus NUMA APIs, plus heaven knows what sort of /proc tuning
might have also gone on. :) No one saw the need to reach for the DEVICE_PUBLIC
functionality.

Sure, I don't see much difference either. Either way seems fine.
