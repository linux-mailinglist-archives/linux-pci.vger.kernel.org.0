FROM MR. DABIRE BASOLE
AUDIT & ACCOUNT MANAGER
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO
WEST AFRICA.

Dear Friend,

With due respect, I have decided to contact you on a business
transaction that will be beneficial to both of us. At the bank last
account and auditing evaluation, my staffs came across an old account
which was being maintained by a foreign client who we learn was among
the deceased passengers of motor accident on November.2003, the
deceased was unable to run this account since his death. The account
has remained dormant without the knowledge of his family since it was
put in a safe deposit account in the bank for future investment by the
client.

Since his demise, even the members of his family haven't applied for
claims over this fund and it has been in the safe deposit account
until I discovered that it cannot be claimed since our client is a
foreign national and we are sure that he has no next of kin here to
file claims over the money. As the director of the department, this
discovery was brought to my office so as to decide what is to be done.
I decided to seek ways through which to transfer this money out of the
bank and out of the country too.

The total amount in the account is USD$18.6 ( Eighteen Million Six Hundred
Thousand United Stated Dollars) with my positions as
staffs of the bank, I am handicapped because I cannot operate foreign
accounts and cannot lay bonafide claim over this money. The client was
a foreign national and you will only be asked to act as his next of
kin and I will supply you with all the necessary information and bank
data to assist you in being able to transfer this money to any bank of
your choice where this money could be transferred into.

The total sum will be shared as follows: 50% for me, 50% for you,
while 10% will map aside for any expenses incidental occur during the
transfering of this fund into your bank account. and the expenses
should be the first thing to be remove before sharing of this fund
according to our percentages . The transfer is risk free on both sides
hence you are going to follow my instruction till the fund transfer to
your account. Since I work in this bank that is why you should be
confident in the success of this transaction because you will be
updated with information as at when desired.

I will wish you to keep this transaction secret and confidential as I
am hoping to retire with my share of this money at the end of
transaction which will be when this money is safety in your account. I
will then come over to your country for sharing according to the
previously agreed percentages. You might even have to advise me on
possibilities of investment in your country or elsewhere of our
choice. May God help you to help me to a restive retirement, Amen,

Please for further information and inquires feel free to contact me
back immediately for more explanation and better understanding I want
you to assure me your capability of handling this project with trust
by providing me your following information details such as:

(1)NAME..............
(2)AGE:................
(3)SEX:.....................
(4)PHONE NUMBER:.................
(5)OCCUPATION:................ .....
(6)YOUR COUNTRY:.....................

Yours sincerely,

Mr. Dabire Basole.
