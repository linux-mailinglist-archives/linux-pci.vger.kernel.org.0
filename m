Old kernel (incorrectly) reports Root Port and Endpoint device from the
other end of the link to the same bus zero. Hence the difference in bus
number between old kernel and new kernel.

So it looks like that issue is with DT based setup.

Just by a chance, could you try to boot kernel with pcie_aspm=off or
pci=nomsi cmdline options? There are some issues in driver/controller
related to link retraining and MSI interrupts which ASPM kernel code can
trigger.

This 'magic' is there because of broken PCIe controller and its PCIe
Root Port in all 32-bit Marvell SoCs.
