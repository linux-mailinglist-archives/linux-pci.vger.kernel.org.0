If the parent address values don't matter I think we can just leave
them as zeroes and be done with it (explaining why obviously).

Something like this (with a big fat comment added summarizing this

Lizhi are you able to test it please at least to check it does not break
anything before I make it a patch for the MLs ?

Any concerns ?
