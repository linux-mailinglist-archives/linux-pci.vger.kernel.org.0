I don't understand this very well, but I think we do need to consider
the latencies along the entire path.  PCIe r5.0, sec 5.4.1.3, contains
this:

  Power management software, using the latency information reported by
  all components in the Hierarchy, can enable the appropriate level of
  ASPM by comparing exit latency for each given path from Root to
  Endpoint against the acceptable latency that each corresponding
  Endpoint can withstand.

Also this:

  5.4.1.3.1 Software Flow for Enabling or Disabling ASPM

  Following is an example software algorithm that highlights how to
  enable or disable ASPM in a component.

  - PCI Express components power up with an appropriate value in their
    Slot Clock Configuration bit. The method by which they initialize
    this bit is device-specific.

  - PCI Express system software scans the Slot Clock Configuration bit
    in the components on both ends of each Link to determine if both
    are using the same reference clock source or reference clocks from
    separate sources.  If the Slot Clock Configuration bits in both
    devices are Set, they are both using the same reference clock
    source, otherwise they're not.

  - PCI Express software updates the Common Clock Configuration bits
    in the components on both ends of each Link to indicate if those
    devices share the same reference clock and triggers Link
    retraining by writing 1b to the Retrain Link bit in the Link
    Control register of the Upstream component.

  - Devices must reflect the appropriate L0s/L1 exit latency in their
    L0s /L1 Exit Latency fields, per the setting of the Common Clock
    Configuration bit.

  - PCI Express system software then reads and calculates the L0s/L1
    exit latency for each Endpoint based on the latencies reported by
    each Port. Refer to Section 5.4.1.2.2 for an example.

  - For each component with one or more Endpoint Functions, PCI
    Express system software examines the Endpoint L0s/L1 Acceptable
    Latency, as reported by each Endpoint Function in its Link
    Capabilities register, and enables or disables L0s/L1 entry (via
    the ASPM Control field in the Link Control register) accordingly
    in some or all of the intervening device Ports on that hierarchy.

> Also, the L0S checks are only done on the local links, is this

ASPM configuration is done on both ends of a link.  I'm not sure it
makes sense to enable any state (L0s, L1, L1.1, L1.2) unless both ends
of the link support it.  In particular, sec 5.4.1.3 says:

  Software must not enable L0s in either direction on a given Link
  unless components on both sides of the Link each support L0s;
  otherwise, the result is undefined.

But I think we do need to consider the entire path when enabling L0s;
from sec 7.5.3.3:

  Endpoint L0s Acceptable Latency - This field indicates the
  acceptable total latency that an Endpoint can withstand due to the
  transition from L0s state to the L0 state. It is essentially an
  indirect measure of the Endpointâ€™s internal buffering.  Power
  management software uses the reported L0s Acceptable Latency number
  to compare against the L0s exit latencies reported by all components
  comprising the data path from this Endpoint to the Root Complex Root
  Port to determine whether ASPM L0s entry can be used with no loss of
  performance.

Does any of that help answer your question?
