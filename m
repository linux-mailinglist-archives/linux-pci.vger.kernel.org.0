Oh, thank you!  I completely missed those new registers.

Thanks, I had looked at 8.3.3.3, but missed the extra 16, 32, and 64
GT/s registers because 8.3.3.3 looks more like guidance for hardware
design and firmware to calculate the values, and it doesn't mention
the registers the OS would program.

Sorry for confusing things!
