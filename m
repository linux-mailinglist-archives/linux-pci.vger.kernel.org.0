Very nice!  Do you have plans to send v2 that include this information or
you reckon this is something Bjorn could add when merging if he has the
time, of course.

Got it.  Thank you!

I had a look and, does the following:

	pci_info(dev, "invalid VPD tag %#04x (size %zu) at offset %zu%s\n",
		 header[0], size, off, off == 0 ?
		 "; assume missing optional EEPROM" : "");

Still apply to having too many tags?  Would the error make sense?  Forgive
me for asking about this, especially as I am not a VPD expert, and was
simply wondering.

Also, does pci_info() there makes sense?  Not pci_warn() or pci_err(), just
so this message has more appropriate weight and logging level.  What do you
think?
