For testing purposes, setpci is still a very good tool.

This described firmware crashing & card reset logic I saw in more wifi
cards. Sometimes even wifi drivers itself detects that card does not
respond and do some its own internal card reset (e.g. iwldvm on laptop).
So it very common situation.

But I have not seen that these cards on laptop issue CRS response. Maybe
because their firmware or PCIe logic bootup too fast (so there is a very
little window for CRS response) or because CRS response sent to OS did
not cause any issue.

So no particular workaround is needed for above described scenario.


But anyway, in case that in future there would be need for disabling CRS
feature in kernel (e.g. for doing some workaround for endpoint or
extended pcie switch) then this re-issuing of config request on CRS
response in pci-aardvark.c would be needed to have similar behavior like
real HW hen CRS is disabled.

And I like the idea if driver is "feature complete" and prepared also
for other _valid_ code paths. This is just my opinion.
