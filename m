Ok, yes i understand, I will add the check.

I'm not aware of any unit tests at the moment. My testing so far has 
been against these patches: 
https://review.trustedfirmware.org/q/topic:"Arm_PCI_Config_Space_Interface"

But given the next version does the PCI_FEATURES calls, that will 
satisfy your concern, right?
