Hello!

> PCIe Gen 4 spec introduced new extended capability mandatory for all
> ports - Lane Margining at the Receiver. This new feature allows to get an
> approximation of the Link eye margin diagram by four points. This
> information shows how resistant the Link is to external influences and can
> be useful for link debugging and presets tuning.
> Previously, this information was only available using a hardware debugger.
> 
> Patch series consists of two parts:
> 
> * Patch for lspci to add Margining registers reading. There is not much
>   information available without issuing any margining commands, but this
>   info is useful anyway;
> * New pcilmr utility.
> 
> Margining capability assumes the exchange of commands with the device, so
> its support was implemented as a separate utility pcilmr.
> The pcilmr allows you to test Links and supports all the features provided
> by the Margining capability. The utility is written using a pcilib, it is
> divided into a library part and a main function with arguments parsing in
> the pciutils root dir.
> Man page is provided as well.
> 
> Utility compilation and man page preparation are integrated into the
> pciutils Makefile, so run make is enough to start testing the utility
> (Gen 4/5 device is required though).
> Utility was written with Linux in mind and was tested only on this OS.

Thanks for your contribution. The utility will need some cleanups,
but overall I will be glad to accept it.

				Have a nice fortnight
