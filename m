I did see Alex's message, but it didn't answer the question of whether
this is a hardware defect or a Linux defect.  "It works fine in
Windows" doesn't mean the hardware conforms to the spec.

PCIe r5.0, sec 5.3.1.4 says "... System Software must allow a minimum
recovery time following a D3Hot â†’ D0 transition of at least 10 ms (see
Section 7.9.17), prior to accessing the Function."

If the hardware isn't ready in 10ms, I'd claim that's a hardware
defect.

If Linux isn't waiting the 10ms, I'd claim that's a Linux defect.

If things work by waiting 100ms, that's nice, but what's the point of
specs if we have to increase the time and penalize everybody just to
accommodate some oddball device?
