Usage is in patch 4/4. lspci with this change and also with patch 4/4 can
distinguish between states: 1) PCI-to-PCI bridge does not support IO and
2) PCI-to-PCI bridge has enabled IO forwarding range set to 0x0000-0x0fff.
Both these two states have IO_BASE and IO_LIMIT registers set to zeros.
lspci currently decodes IO_BASE=IO_LIMIT=0x00 as IO forwarding range is
enabled and set to range 0x0000-0x0fff.
