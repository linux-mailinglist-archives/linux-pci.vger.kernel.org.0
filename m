Implement the irqchip kernel driver for the Arm GICv5 architecture,
as described in the GICv5 beta0 specification, available at:

https://developer.arm.com/documentation/aes0070

The GICv5 architecture is composed of multiple components:

- one or more IRS (Interrupt Routing Service)
- zero or more ITS (Interrupt Translation Service)
- zero or more IWB (Interrupt Wire Bridge)

The GICv5 host kernel driver is organized into units corresponding
to GICv5 components.

The GICv5 architecture defines the following interrupt types:

- PPI (PE-Private Peripheral Interrupt)
- SPI (Shared Peripheral Interrupt)
- LPI (Logical Peripheral Interrupt)

This series adds sysreg entries required to automatically generate
GICv5 registers handling code, one patch per-register.

This patch series is split into patches matching *logical* entities,
to make the review easier.

Logical entities:

- PPI
- IRS/SPI
- LPI/IPI
- SMP enablement
- ITS

The salient points of the driver are summarized below.

=============
1. Testing
=============

Patchset tested with an architecturally compliant FVP model with
the following setup:

- 1 IRS
- 1 and 2 ITSes
- 1 and 2 IWBs

configured with different parameters that vary the IRS(IST) and
ITS(DT/ITT) table levels and INTID/DEVICEID/EVENTID bits.

Trusted-Firmware (TF-A) was used for device tree bindings and component
initializations.

Guidelines to set-up the FVP model, kernel and TF-A in order to
bootstrap the GICv5 software stack are outlined in this wikipage,
it will be kept up-to-date with the latest developments:

https://linaro.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CQAF-wY

================
2. Driver design
================

=====================
2.1 GICv5 DT bindings
=====================

The DT bindings attempt to map directly to the GICv5 component
hierarchy, with a top level node corresponding to the GICv5 "system",
having IRS child nodes, that have in turn ITS child nodes.

The IWB is defined in a separate schema; its relationship with the ITS
is explicit through the msi-parent property required to define the IWB
deviceID.

===================
2.2 GICv5 top level
===================

The top-level GICv5 irqchip driver implements separate IRQ
domains - one for each interrupt type, PPI (PE-Private Peripheral
Interrupt), SPI (Shared Peripheral Interrupt) and LPI (Logical
Peripheral Interrupt).

The top-level exception handler routes the IRQ to the relevant IRQ
domain for handling according to the interrupt type detected when the
IRQ is acknowledged.

All IRQs are set to the same priority value.

The driver assumes that the GICv5 components implement enough
physical address bits to address the full system RAM, as required
by the architecture; it does not check whether the physical address
ranges of memory allocated for IRS/ITS tables are within the GICv5
physical address range.

Components are probed by relying on the early DT irqchip probing
scheme. The probing is carried out hierarchically, starting from
the top level.

The IWB driver has been reworked to match an MBIgen like interface.

Power management and Kexec are not yet supported at this stage.

=============
2.3 GICv5 IRS
=============

The GICv5 IRS driver probes and manages SPI interrupts by detecting their
presence and by providing the top-level driver the information required
to set up the SPI interrupt domain.

The GICv5 IRS driver also parses from firmware Interrupt AFFinity ID
(IAFFID) IDs identifying cores and sets up IRS IRQ routing.

The GICv5 IRS driver allocates memory to handle the IRS tables.

The IRS LPI interrupts state is kept in an Interrupt State Table (IST)
and it is managed through CPU instructions.

The IRS driver allocates the IST table that, depending on available HW
features can be either 1- or 2-level.

If the IST is 2-level, memory for the level-2 table entries
is allocated on demand (ie when LPIs are requested), using an IRS
mechanism to make level-1 entry valid on demand after the IST
has already been enabled.

Chunks of memory allocated for IST entries can be smaller or larger than
PAGE_SIZE and are required to be physically contiguous within an IST level
(i.e. a linear IST is a single memory block, a 2-level IST is made up of a
block of memory for the L1 table, whose entries point at different L2 tables
that are in turn allocated as memory chunks).

LPI INTIDs are allocated in software using an IDA. IDA does not support
allocating ranges, which is a bit cumbersome because this forces us
to allocate IDs one by one where the LPIs could actually be allocated
in chunks.

An IDA was chosen because basically it is a dynamic bitmap, which
carries out memory allocation automatically.

Other drivers/subsystems made different choices to allocate ranges,
an IDA was chosen since it is part of the core kernel and an IDA
range API is in the making.

IPIs are implemented using LPIs and a hierarchical domain is created
specifically for IPIs using the LPI domain as a parent.

arm64 IPI management core code is augmented with a new API to handle
IPIs that are not per-cpu interrupts and force the affinity of the LPI
backing an IPI to a specific and immutable value.

=============
2.4 GICv5 ITS
=============

The ITS driver partially reuses the existing GICv3/v4 MSI-parent
infrastructure and on top builds an IRQ domain needed to enable message
based IRQs.

ITS tables - DT (device table) and ITT (Interrupt Translation Table) are
allocated according to the number of required deviceIDs and eventIDs on
a per device basis. The ITS driver relies on the kmalloc() interface
because memory pages must be physically contiguous within a table level
and can be < or > than PAGE_SIZE.

=============
2.5 GICv5 IWB
=============

The IWB driver has been reworked to match an MBIgen like interface.

A new MSI flag (MSI_ALLOC_FLAGS_FIXED_MSG_DATA) had to be added for MSI
allocation in that the IWB has a fixed eventID per-wire and the ITS driver
code is not allowed to allocate eventIDs dynamically for events backing IWB
wires.

===================
3. Acknowledgements
===================

The patchset was co-developed with T.Hayes and S.Bischoff from
Arm - thank you so much for your help.

A big thank you to M.Zyngier for his fundamental help/advice.

If you have some time to help us review this series and get it into
shape, thank you very much.
