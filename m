Yes, that is truth.

Yes.

Controlling PERST# via pci_reset_fn_methods[] is not enough.
pci_reset_fn_methods[PERST]() would do something like this:

1. Assert PERST# (put card into reset)
2. Delay some time period (this is open question how long it should be)
3. De-assert PERST# (put card from reset into normal state)

But in some other functions it would be needed to put card into reset
state and let it in this state (e.g. in power down, driver unbind,
etc...). So pci_reset_fn_methods[PERST] would not be possible to use it
here.

I was thinking to provide just callback bridge->set_perst(enable) and
then implement pci_reset_fn_methods[PERST] via this callback.

If that callback is NULL then PCI core code can assign default
"set_perst" callback which use gpiod_set_value. Like in your pseudocode
below.

Drivers which have inverted polarity of PERTST# gpio or drivers which
have custom way for controlling this pin would have to provide
appropriate callbacks.
