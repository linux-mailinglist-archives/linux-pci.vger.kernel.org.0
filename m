My idea is to add new "framework" to allow drivers implement new
callbacks for this "framework". There would be no change in drivers
which do not provide these callbacks to ensure that nothing is going to
be broken. I'm planning to implement these callbacks only for RC drivers
for which I have hardware and can properly test to not introduce any
regression. For other existing RC drivers it is up to other authors +
testers. But to decrease future maintenance cost of all RC drivers I
expect that new drivers would not implement any ad-hoc solution in their
"probe" function and instead implement these new callbacks. That is my
idea.

Perfect! If you have any concerns or you see any issues, please reply
that my RFC email. So I can collect feedback.

Also I sent draft for updating DTS schema for PCIe devices:
