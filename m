VRX200 SoC(internally called VR9) was the first PCIe SoC product which 
was using synopsys

controller v3.30a. It only supports PCIe Gen1.1/1.0. The phy is internal 
phy from infineon.

After that, we have other PCe 1.1/10. products such as ARX300/390.Â  
However, these products are EOL,

that is why we don't put effort to support VRX200/ARX300/390.

PCIE_LANTIQ was also a name used internally in the product as in 
linux-3.10.x.

As I mentioned, VRX200 was a very old PCIe Gen1.1 product. In our latest 
SoC Lightning

Mountain, we are using synopsys controller 5.20/5.50a. We support 
Gen2(XRX350/550),

Gen3(PRX300) and GEN4(X86 based SoC). We also supported dual lane and 
single lane.

Some of the above registers are needed to control FTS, link width and 
link speed.

intel_pcie_link_setup is to record maximum speed and and link width. We need these
to change speed and link width on the fly which is not supported by dwc driver common
source.
There are two major purposes.
1. For cable applications, they have battery support mode. In this case, it has to
switch from x2 and gen4 to x1 and gen1 on the fly
2. Some customers have high EMI issues. They can try to switch to lower speed and
lower link width to check on the fly. Otherwise, they have to change the device tree
and reboot the system.

We can support up to XRX350/XRX500/PRX300 for MIPS SoC since we still

sell these products. However, we have no effort to support EOL product

such as VRX200 which also makes driver quite complex since the glue

logic(reset, clock and endianness). For MIPS based platform, we have

endianness control in device tree such as inbound_swap and outbound_swap

For VRX200, we have another big concern, that is PCI and PCIe has coupling

for endiannes which makes things very bad.

However, if you are interested in supporting VRX200, it is highly 
appreciated.

For MIPS base SoC, there is no interrupt controller for such APP registers.

They are directly connected with centralized PIC(ICU for VRX200/ARX300, GIC

for XRX500/PRX300, IOAPIC for lightning mountain).That is why we don't

implement the interrupt controller here.

This is needed. In the old driver, we fixed this by fixup. The original 
comment as follows,

/*
 Â * The root complex has a hardwired class of PCI_CLASS_NETWORK_OTHER or
 Â * PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST, when it is operating as a root complex this
 Â * needs to be switched to * PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI

Great! even link_device_setup can be reduced since pcie_get_speed_cap is

implementing similar stuff.

There are different purpose. rst_interval is purely for asserted reset 
pulse.

Here 100ms is to make sure the initial state keeps at least 100ms, then we

can reset.

Not sure I understand what you mean.Â  As you know from the code, we have 
lpp->id which means

we have multiple instances of Root Complex(1,2,3,4,8), so we need this 
for identification.

this irq in old product called ir(integrated interrupt or misc interrupt).

Yes. If we plan to support old MIPS SoC, we have a lot of clocks. The

code is from old code. We can remove this wrapper for new SoC. Later we

can add them back.

In most embedded package, lspci from busybox only showed deviceid and

They don't install lspci utilities.

bind/unbind case we use this. For extreme cases, we use unbind and bind 
to reset

PCI instead of rebooting.

Agree. For X86/64, MSI is handled by X86 arch. We don't need to

implement another MSI controller separately.

For MIPS based SoC, we don't use synopsys MSI controller. The MSI still

connects with central interrupt controller with MSI decoding (we can name it

as MSI controller)

Dilip should explain this
