I think something read from sysfs is a snapshot with no guarantee
about how long it will remain valid, so I don't see a problem with the
value being stale by the time userspace consumes it.

If there's a downside to doing two separate reads, we could mention
that in the commit log or a comment.

If there's not a specific reason for using READ_ONCE(), I think we
should omit it because using it in one place but not others suggests
that there's something special about this place.
