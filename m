But what happens right now, when a device driver like the NVMe driver
calls pci_enable_pcie_error_reporting() ? There is also no checking,
if the connected Root Port or some switch / bridge in-between supports
AER or not. IIUTC, this is identical to what this patch here does.
Enable AER in the device and if the upstream infrastructure does not
support AER, then the AER event will just not be received by the
Kernel. Which is most likely not worse than not enabling AER at all
on this device. Or am I missing something?

Agreed, this is another area to look into. Not sure if it's okay to
address this, once this patch-set has been accepted (if it will be).

Thanks,
