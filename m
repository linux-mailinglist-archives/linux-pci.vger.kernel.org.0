You are not missing anything ;-) Indeed it should belong there, and I
think we are also missing now the "optimization" for devices behind slow
link without active link reporting capabilities. That is we wait for the
1s instead of the whole 60s.

This is not intentional. I will add it back in the next version.

To summarize the v4 patch would look something like below. Only compile
tested but I will run real testing later today. I think it now includes
the 1s optimization and also checking of the active link reporting
support for the devices behind slow links. Let me know is I missed
something. 

It is getting rather complex unfortunately :(
