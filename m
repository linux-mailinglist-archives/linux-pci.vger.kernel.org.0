Super.  IIUC, i.MX6 is another DWC-based controller, so this looks
like another case of the issue that afflicts amlogic, keystone,
loongson (weirdly apparently *not* DWC-based), meson, and probably
others.

Some previous discussion here:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20210707155418.GA897940@bjorn-Precision-5520/

This sounds like a defect in the CPU/PCI host adapter.  If the device
initiates a 4096-byte read and the CPU or whatever can't deal with it,
the host adapter should break it up into whatever the CPU *can*
handle.  I don't think this is the device's problem or the device
driver's problem.

There is no mechanism in the PCIe or ACPI spec for the driver to learn
the maximum MRRS value the CPU can tolerate.

Yes.

I don't know the details of this particular situation, but ideally,
drivers should not change MRRS or MPS.  If they do, they definitely
need to use a PCI core interface like pcie_set_readrq() because these
are system-level parameters that need to be considered in relation to
other devices in the hierarchy and sometimes to problems in the PCI
host adapter.

How do we learn the maximum safe value?  Is this something a native
driver could read from PCIE_PL_MRCCR0 (see below)?

This sounds like a real train wreck if any of these designs want to
use ACPI.  There's nothing in ACPI to communicate a "maximum safe
MRRS" value to the OS.

Not that I'm aware of.
