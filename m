But here it is needed to do something different. It is needed to do
inverse mapping of function which converts PCI bus address to CPU
physical address of CPU memory. So to converting CPU physical address of
CPU memory to PCI bus address from PCI bus point of view.

I think that this information is stored in dma_ranges member of struct
pci_host_bridge. But function pcibios_resource_to_bus() looks at the
->windows member which converts CPU physical address of PCI memory (not
CPU memory) to PCI bus address, which is something different. So
pcibios_resource_to_bus() would not work here and it may return
incorrect values (as PCI memory may be different from CPU point of view
and PCI bus point of view).

I agree, it is incorrect but I do not see a way how to do it correctly
because of missing function (which for pci-aardvark should return
identity).
