Hello Aaron,

Thanks for your insights. A follow-up query and some observations in-line.

I believe that vgaswitcheroo takes care of this for us.

Right, so for a little more context: a while ago I noticed that my 
laptop (lucky me, Asus K501UB) has a 940M with HDA but no codec. Seems 
legit, given how this GPU has no displays attached; they're all hooked 
up to the Intel integrated GPU. That threw off the snd_hda_intel 
mid-probe, and as a result didn't permit runpm, keeping the entire GPU, 
PCIe bus and thus the CPU package awake. A bit of hackerly later we 
decided to continue probing without a codec, and now my laptop is happy, 
but...
A new problem popped up with several other NVIDIA GPUs that expose their 
HDA subdevice, but somehow its inaccessible. Relevant lines from a 
users' log:

Now I don't know what's going on, but the snd_hda_intel messages are 
ominous. And so are the ACPI warnings. But I don't know how much these 
two are related.

You say that it is desirable to switch on HDA at boot-time because the 
PCI subsystem doesn't play nicely with changing a device to 
multi-function. That rules out the option of only enabling the HDA 
device once a cable is plugged in. Are there any other trap doors that 
snd_hda_intel needs to navigate around to make this work fault free on 
all hardware, such as:
- Codecs not revealing themselves until a display is plugged in, 
requiring perhaps a "codec reprobe" and "codec remove" event from 
nouveau/rm to snd_hda_intel,
- Borked BIOSes just blindly assigning the MMIO space of the HDA device 
to another device, or nothing at all,
- ... other things that might give any of us nightmares and heart burn?

Thanks!

Roy
