Hi Ilpo,

Thanks your for reply. Will change.

Will delete it.

__pci_find_next_cap_ttl uses pci_bus as the first argument, and other 
functions take pci_dev->bus as its first argument. Either way, either 
pci_bus or pci_dev is required, and before pcie enumeration, there was 
no pci_bus or pci_dev.

I replied to you in the patch email [v6 3/5], if I wasn't clear enough, 
please remind me and we'll discuss it again.

The config space register cannot be read before PCIe enumeration. Only 
the read and write functions of the root port driver can be used.
