Subject: [PATCH V9 0/5] PCI: Loongson pci improvements and quirks 
Date:   Fri, 27 Aug 2021 16:20:26 +0800

X-Mailing-List: linux-pci@vger.kernel.org

This patchset improves Loongson PCI controller driver and resolves some
problems: LS2K/LS7A's PCI config space supports 1/2/4-bytes access, so
the first patch use pci_generic_config_read()/pci_generic_config_write()
for them; the second patch add ACPI init support which will be used by
LoongArch; the third patch improves the mrrs quirk for LS7A chipset; The
fourth patch add a new quirk for LS7A chipset to avoid poweroff/reboot
failure, and the fifth patch add a new quirk for LS7A chipset to fix the
multifunction devices' irq pin mappings.

V1 -> V2:
1, Rework the 4th patch;
2, Improve commit messages;
3, Remove the last patch since there is better solutions.

V2 -> V3:
1, Add more affected device ids for the 4th patch;
2, Improve commit messages to describe root causes.

V3 -> V4:
1, Rework the MRRS quirk patch;
2, Improve commit messages to describe root causes, again.

V4 -> V5:
1, Improve the MRRS quirk patch;
2, Change the order of 2nd and 3rd patch;
3, Improve commit messages to describe root causes, again.

V5 -> V6:
1, Rework the 1st patch;
2, Adjust the order of the series.

V6 -> V7:
1, Use correct pci config access operations;
2, Add ACPI init support for LoongArch;
3, Don't move to quirks.c since the driver has ACPI support;
4, Some other minor improvements.

V7 -> V8:
1, Use CFG1 method for LS2K/LS7A pci config.

V8 -> V9:
1, Use pci_controller_data for the first patch. 

Huacai Chen, Tiezhu Yang and Jianmin Lv(5):
 PCI: loongson: Use correct pci config access operations.
 PCI: loongson: Add ACPI init support.
 PCI: Improve the MRRS quirk for LS7A.
 PCI: Add quirk for LS7A to avoid reboot failure.
 PCI: Add quirk for multifunction devices of LS7A.
