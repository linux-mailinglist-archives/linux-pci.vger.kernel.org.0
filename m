It doesn't matter how many RPs there are. What matters is what are the 
properties associated with.

It's allowed because we are stuck things with the wrong way. That 
doesn't mean we should continue to do so.

That's the RP though, isn't it?

There is one difference in location though. If the properties are in the 
RP, then they should be handled by the PCI core and override what's read 
from the RP registers. If the properties are in the host bridge node, 
then the host bridge driver sets the values in some host bridge specific 
registers (or has a way to make read-only regs writeable) which get 
reflected in the RP registers. So perhaps in the host bridge is the 
correct place.
