Thanks a lot for you input here. Please find some comments below...

This seems not correct. From the ML link reported by Bjorn, there seems
to be a platform specific interrupt on ZynqMP, to report the AER events.
At least this is how I interpret the patch from Bharat from that time.
In the meantime Bharat from Xilinx has sent me a link to a newer,
updated patch series to use this "misc" interrupts for AER instead. I'll
get into more details on this in another reply.

Here the BridgeCtl of the Root Port:

The command registers have SERR disabled on all PCIe devices:
   Control: I/O- Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- 
Stepping- SERR- FastB2B- DisINTx-

Not sure if this is a problem. I would expect the Kernel PCI subsystem
and the AER driver to enable the necessary bits. So is 'SERR-' here
a problem?

Device Control has the error reporting enabled:
   DevCtl: CorrErr+ NonFatalErr+ FatalErr+ UnsupReq+

Here is what the Root Port reports:

Mask (..Msk) is set to "-" which is correct for not masking this error
I assume.

Me neither.

Agreed.

At least this seems to be the case. Even though I'm still not receiving
the surprise down error status with additional change. More to this in
the other mail.

That is my understanding and best guess right now as well.
