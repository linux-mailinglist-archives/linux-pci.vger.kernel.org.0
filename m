My understanding of these sections is that they still have to be
deliverable via standard interrupts (INTx / MSI) if root port supports
standard interrupts:

"If a Root Port or Root Complex Event Collector is enabled for
level-triggered interrupt signaling using the INTx messages, the virtual
INTx wire must be asserted..."

"If a Root Port or Root Complex Event Collector is enabled for
edge-triggered interrupt signaling using MSI or MSI-X, an interrupt
message must be sent every time..."

This callback is used only for root port. So I would suggest to put
_root port_ into the name of the callback to indicate it. To distinguish
for which devices is callback designed because other callbacks (e.g.
map_irq) are used for any device.

This callback is root port specific and therefore struct pci_dev *
pointer should be passed as callback argument. Host bridge may have
multiple root ports, so passing only host bridge is not enough.

Maybe it would be better to pass struct pci_dev * instead of struct
pci_host_bridge * As from pci_dev can be easily derived host bridge.

Anyway, this callback looks to be very useful, I would like to use it in
pci-aardvark.c and pci-mvebu.c drivers for better mapping of PME, AER
and HP interrupts. And pci-mvebu.c is multi root port driver, so needs
pci_dev*.

And my guess is that this callback can be useful for adding AER support
also for pcie-uniphier.c driver, as replacement for this (rather ugly)

So I would be happy to see it!
