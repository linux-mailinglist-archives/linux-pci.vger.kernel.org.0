Good morning,

looking for companies interested in raising additional capital by diversi=

smetics for body and hair care.

The distribution of innovative products corresponding to the current pref=

lows our partners to gain new markets and achieve better economic results=
=2E

In addition to products with bactericidal action, our range includes show=
er gels, shampoos and hair conditioners, as well as efficient, concentrat=
ed detergents.

The versatility (suitable for all skin types) combined with an affordable=
 price means that customers make an informed choice of a product among ot=
hers available on the market.

Are you interested in cooperation?

Ethan Smith
