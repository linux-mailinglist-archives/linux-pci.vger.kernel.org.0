There is no information in available documentation how to implement
MSI-X in Root Complex mode, so currently MSI-X is not possible.

Well, 32 MSI interrupts is not enough for new modern wifi cards. E.g.
QCA6390 (ath11k) wifi card requires 32 interrupts and when this card is
connected to 2 port PCIe packet switch then packet switch requires 3
additional interrupts (1 for downstream and 1 for each upstream = 1+2).
So in this setup at least 64 MSI interrupts are required because PCI
functions of packet switch are initialized first (take interrupts 0,1,2)
and then is initialized wifi card which requires 32 aligned interrupts
(so 32,33,...,63). This setup is common on existing A3720 hardware:
Turris Mox with Mox G module.

Currently aardvark driver unmask all MSI interrupts and does not
implement masking/unmasking callbacks for individual interrupts.
Currently it has implemented support for 32 individual interrupts.

So it is an issue if masking / unmasking stay unimplemented?

Ok!

So it is basically everything related to MSI interrupts in that diagram.

Global enable is needed to call also when HW resume from suspend state.
Suspend is not currently implemented, but I would like to know what is
the preferred way, where to put "MSI initialization code" which needs
to be called for "global initialization & enable" and also after wakeup
from suspend. Has struct irq_chip callback for this action? Or such code
really should be called in driver probe function and then also in driver
resume function?
