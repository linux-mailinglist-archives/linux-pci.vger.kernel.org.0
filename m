Hi,

cronologic is a small company in Frankfurt, Germany that is building 
PCIe boards for high end data acquisition, especially time-to-digital 
converters:
https://www.cronologic.de/ <https://www.cronologic.de/>

We intend to support Linux in the future but the last time anybody in 
our company did linux development was 15 years ago.

We would like to hire someone who can spend a few hours to give our 
developers a head start with information like:
- What libraries to use?
- Where to find documentation?
- What approach to use for the driver? (e.g. when do we need a kernel 
module and when is a user mode driver sufficient).

Depending on your preference this could be a one hour chat where you 
answer our question or a contract to program a walkable sceleton for us.

Please contact me at kolja@cronologic.de if you are interested in 
supporting us.

Regards,

Kolja Sulimma
