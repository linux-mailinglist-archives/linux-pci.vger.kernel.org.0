We understand that, and we agree with this. However, the point was more about
WHY these patches were not applied earlier as many of them were fully reviewed
for several weeks. We have more patches to send out that depend on all these
deferred patches, and this deferring is delaying us as well. It would be great
if going forward, a more timely processing & applying of reviewed patches
happened. Thank you.
