I rewrote some logs, dropped some stable tags. This series raised
a couple of interesting questions that may be relevant for PCI core
as well, it'd be great if those won't be lost but I feel it is time
to merge this series to help Marek/Pali cut the patch delta and
give this code wider testing.

I have applied it to pci/aardvark, please _do_ have a look and
report back any issue with it.
