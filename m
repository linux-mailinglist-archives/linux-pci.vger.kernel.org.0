Just in general.  I saw this recently with a Nuvoton NPCM8xx PCIe
controller.  I'm not an arm64 guy, but I've been told that these
aborts are basically unrecoverable from a kernel perspective.  For
some reason several PCIe controllers intended for arm64 seem to raise
aborts on PCIe errors.  At the moment, that means we can't recover
from errors like surprise unplugs and other things that *should* be
recoverable (perhaps at the cost of resetting or disabling a PCIe
device).

Fingers crossed for either that or some other way to make these things
recoverable.

Right, my fault.  The error report registers don't look like standard
PCIe things, so I suppose they are on the host side, not the PCIe
side, so they're probably guaranteed to be accessible and non-racy
unless the bridge is in reset.
