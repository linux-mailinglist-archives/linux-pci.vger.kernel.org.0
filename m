What is "prolonged period of time"? Because for example PCIe controller
on A3720 has upper limit about 1.5s when accessing config space. This is
what I measured in real example. It really took PCIe HW more than 1s to
return error code if it happens.

I'm thinking if it is really safe here. On dual-core system, there may
be two tasks (on each CPU) which calls pcie_capability_read_word() (or
other access function). Exactly one pass pci lock. And after that two
different interrupts (for each CPU) may occur which handlers would like
to call pcie_capability_read_word(). raw_spin_lock_irqsave (which is
called from pci_lock_config()) disable interrupts on local CPU, right?
But what with second CPU? Could not be there issue?

And what would happen if pcie_capability_read_word() is locked for 1.5s
as described above? Does not look safe for me.
