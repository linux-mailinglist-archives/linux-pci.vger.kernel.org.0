My understanding is that neither "System Error", nor "Error Interrupt".
But patch series is about "dedicated IRQ lines for services". One of
PCIe service is AER, which is one of the mostly used PCIe service in
kernel and therefore it is the root of confusions with keyword "error".

I think too, that this does not conform to PCIe spec.

I agree.
