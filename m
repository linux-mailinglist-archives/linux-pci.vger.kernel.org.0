Well they should be agnostic to each other, but are they really? I mean 
we could have inter device lock dependencies because of DMA-buf or good 
knows what.

Yeah and disabling or ignoring the lockdep warning could cause problems 
because we don't see issues caused by inter device lock dependencies any 
more.

I just have the feeling that this would cause a lot of problems.
