I was very short of time today but I did apply the above series to the
5.15.y branch (since I had this source available), resulting in version
5.15.141+.  Unfortunately, in the rush I forgot to do a clean after the
bisect reset, so the resulting kernel was not correctly built.  It booted
but thought it was a different version and therefore none of the modules
could be found.  As a result, the test is invalid.

I will try again in a week when I next have physical access to the system. 
Apologies for the delay.  In the meantime, if there's a specific kernel I
should apply the patch series against please let me know.  As I understand
it, you want it applied to one of the kernels which failed, making 5.15.y
(for y < 145) a reasonable choice.
