No.

They get "authorized" upon plug by boltd based on user decision and
after that the firmware should keep them authorized as long as the
device is connected, including also resume.

It does not affect every single system there with security level set to
"secure". It is just this one AFAICT. Like I said the firmware is
expected to connect the PCIe tunnel (and for some unknown reason in this
particular system it does not).

Well what else can we do here? The link goes down regardless what we do
in the PCI stack. If you want to revert the patch that caused the delay,
fine but that does not cure the problem tha thet device stack get torn
down upon resume. For instance if there is USB stick connected to the
dock and the filesystem is mounted, all that is gone upon resume
regardless of the delay. If you want to detect the "secure" vs. "user"
fine feel free to do so but keep in mind that there are other systems
out there where this works just fine so avoid breaking them.
