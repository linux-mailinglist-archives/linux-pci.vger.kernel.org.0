On Linux "class+subclass+prog_if" can be different than what is in
config registers and the purpose of this patch series with new fields is
to allow user to see difference in lspci.

On Windows access to real config space is not available for non-system
users.

So like PCI_FILL_SUBSYS flag in this patch series?
