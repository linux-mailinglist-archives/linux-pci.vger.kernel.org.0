I totally agree, although I do not see power consumption significantly
increased. Also I checked all other PCI controller drivers and no one
else doing this.

In fact not calling rearm() from __brcm_pcie_remove() is not enough
because the .probe will fail thus rescal reset will loose it's instance
and next probed pcie root port will issue rescal reset again.

I'd stick with avoiding assert of bridge_reset from brcm_pcie_turn_off()
for now, and this will be true only for bcm2712.
