A device's reference count will be non-zero, I'm saying that sometimes,
some driver core functions are called with a 'struct device' that is
NULL, and it can handle it just fine.  Hopefully no callbacks to the
rust code will happen that way, but why aren't you checking just "to be
sure!" otherwise you could have a bug here, and it costs nothing to
verify it, right?

Yes, that's fine, if you are calling this from a probe callback, but
again, the driver core has lots of functions in it :)

Ok, if you say so, should we bookmark this thread for when this does
happen?  :)

What will the rust code do if it is passed in a NULL pointer?  Will it
crash like C code does?  Or something else?
