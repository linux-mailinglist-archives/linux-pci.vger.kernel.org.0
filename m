Subject: [PATCH 07/27] ARM: dts: Configure interconnect target module for dra7 sata

We can now probe devices with device tree only configuration using
ti-sysc interconnect target module driver. Let's configure the
module, but keep the legacy "ti,hwmods" peroperty to avoid new boot
time warnings. The legacy property will be removed in later patches
together with the legacy platform data.

Note that the old sysc register offset is wrong, the real offset is at
0x1100 as listed in TRM for SATA_SYSCONFIG register. Looks like we've been
happily using sata on the bootloader configured sysconfig register and
nobody noticed. Also the old register range for SATAMAC_wrapper registers
is wrong at 7 while it should be 8. But that too seems harmless.

There is also an L3 parent interconnect range that we don't seem to be
using. That can be added as needed later on.
