Yes it's just an example. The properties already exist but it's good to
describe how to put them together for this particular case, because
there isn't a precedent describing the topology for an IOMMU that
appears on the PCI bus.

There is the probe order problem - PCI needs this info before starting
to probe devices on the bus. Maybe we could store the info in a separate
memory region, that is referenced on the command-line and that the guest
can read early.
