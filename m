That explains the issue :)

ahci_init_one() is the function used by the default AHCI driver (ahci.ko), so
this path is correct.

I was way ahead of you :)

If pcim_intx() always gets called on device release, AND MSI/MSIX are also
managed interrupts with a devres action on release, I would say that
pcim_msi_release() should NOT lead to a path calling pci_intx(dev, 0), as that
would create the intx devres again. But given the comment you point out above,
it seems that there are some ordering constraints between disabling msi and intx
? If that is the case, then may be this indeed will be tricky.

I would say that it evaluates to true for any device using intx, which tend to
be rare these days. In such case, then enabling on device attach and disabling
on detach would lead to new != pci_command, including in the hidden intx disable
path triggered by disabling msi. But the devres being recreated on detach
definitely seem to depend on the disabling order though. So we may have been
lucky indeed.
