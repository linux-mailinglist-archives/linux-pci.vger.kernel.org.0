 Well, PCIBIOS_MIN_IO is never set for Malta and therefore stays at 0.  I 
could boot 2.6.11 with the hunk reverted and see what happens, not a big 
deal (I should have old GCC somewhere as a kernel such old would surely be 
a pain to build with modern GCC).  This stuff was badly broken before 
commit ae81aad5c2e1 (and there was support there too for the Atlas board, 
a weird one with a Philips SAA9730 southbridge and supporting a subset of 
the same CPU core cards as the Malta board does).

 I'd have to go through the relevant datasheets to see whether it can 
actually happen in reality.  Perhaps we can just hardwire PCIBIOS_MIN_IO 
to 0x1000 instead, similarly to what other MIPS platforms do.  After all 
Malta's southbridge is on the mainboard and therefore always the same, 
regardless of the northbridge (system controller in MIPS-speak) which 
comes with the pluggable CPU core card.

 NB there are commit c5de50dada14 ("MIPS: Malta: Change start address to 
avoid conflicts.") and commit 27547abf36af ("MIPS: malta: Incorporate 
PIIX4 ACPI I/O region in PCI controller resources") that fiddled with this 
code piece.  Especially the latter one refers additional commits that may 
give further insights.  And the former one removed a "FIXME" annotation, 
which suggests I didn't consider the solution perfect back 20 years ago, 
but given how long it stayed there it was surely good enough for its time.
