I wasn't aware of that and haven't seen anything like that.

The issue was the IOMMU code does not allow for any kind of dynamic
changes in the groups devices are assigned in. In theory, this could be
possible but you'd still at least have to unbind the devices from their
driver because you definitely can't change the IOMMU group while there
are DMA requests in flight. Ultimately it's easier for most use cases to
just disable it on boot.
