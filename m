Clearly not my day when it comes to proofreading commit messages.
Thanks for pointing this out, and in advance for fixing it up.

Absolutely.

I've just managed to run the checker, which comes up with all kinds of
goodies. Apart from the above, it also spots the following:

- arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/mt7622.dtsi: Has a device_type property
  in its main PCIe node, but not in the child nodes. It isn't obvious
  to me whether that's a violation or not (the spec doesn't say
  whether the property should be set on a per-port basis). Rob?

- arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8996.dtsi: Only one out of the three
  PCIe nodes has the device_type property, probably broken similarly
  to rk3399.

I could move the workaround to drivers/pci/of.c, and have it called
from the individual drivers. I don't have the HW to test those though.

Thoughts?
